# The largest and smallest submodules

For a module $M$, the entire module $M$ itself is a submodule, called the **improper** submodule. At the other extreme, the trivial subgroup $\{0\}\subseteq M$ is also a submodule, called the **trivial** submodule. When viewed as a module in its own right, it is usually called the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Examples of modules#The zero module\|zero module]].

# Submodules and ideals

When a ring $R$ is considered as a left $R$-module (via left multiplication), the submodules of $R$ are in (natural) bijection with the left ideals of $R$.

# Submodules and subgroups

[[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Examples of modules#Abelian groups are ${ bf Z}$-modules\|Recall]] that a ${\bf Z}$-module is the same as an abelian group. Under this identification, submodules are in (natural) bijection with subgroups.

# Submodules and vector spaces

[[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Examples of modules#More about vector spaces\|Recall]] that if $F$ is a field, then an $F[x]$-module is the same as an $F$-vector space $V$ together with a linear endomorphism $T:V\to V$. Under this identification, $F[x]$-submodules of $(V,T)$ are the same as $T$-stable subspaces of $V$, i.e., subspaces $U\subseteq V$ such that $T(U)\subseteq U$.

Very similar to the category of all matrices with entries in a fixed ring $R$, we can form a category of all bimodules. The objects of that category are rings (with unity), and arrows $R\to S$ correspond to $(S,R)$-bimodules. In this category, arrow composition corresponds to tensor product of bimodules. More on this later.^[Maybe.]

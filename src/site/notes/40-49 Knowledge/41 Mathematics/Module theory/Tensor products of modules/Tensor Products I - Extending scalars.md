## Restriction of Scalars

Suppose $N$ is an $S$-module and $R\subseteq S$ is a subring. By restricting the action of $S$ on $N$ to an action of $R$ on $N$, we can view $N$ as an $R$-module.^[More generally, suppose $f:R\to S$ is any ring morphism. We can then view $N$ as an $R$-module using the ring morphism $f$ and the action of $S$ on $N$, by defining $r\cdot n = f(r)n$.] You can verify this gives $N$ the structure of an $R$-module and in fact is the object function of a functor $S-\textbf{Mod}\to R-\textbf{Mod}$. We call this functor the **restriction of scalars** from $S$ to $R$.
## Extension of Scalars

In light of the above process, one might ask the question: is it possible to go the other way? In other words, if $M$ is an $R$-module and $R$ is a subring of $S$, is it possible to extend the action of $R$ on $M$ to an action of $S$ on $M$? Sadly, not in general, as the example below illustrates:

>[!note] Example
>Consider the ring ${\bf Z}$ when viewed as a ${\bf Z}$-module (i.e., an abelian group) Even though ${\bf Z}$ is a subring of ${\bf Q}$, we cannot extend the ${\bf Z}$-module structure on ${\bf Z}$ to a ${\bf Q}$-module structure. Why not? Suppose we would, and consider the  the action of $\frac{1}{2}$ on the integer $1$. There would need to be an integer $z$ such that $\frac{1}{2}\star 1 = z$. Since our ${\bf Q}$-action is supposed to extend our ${\bf Z}$-action, it would follow that $2z=1$ in ${\bf Z}$, where here $2z$ denotes the usual^[In fact, the only possible ${\bf Z}$-action!] ${\bf Z}$-action, i.e., $2z=z+z$. Since there is no integer $z$ such that $z+z=1$, we reach a contradiction.

Can we try to do the next best thing, which is to embed the original $R$-module $M$ as an $R$-submodule of a larger $R$-module $N$ that also has the structure of an $S$-module (extending the action of $R$)? Sadly this is also no (at least in general) as the next example illustrates.

>[!note] Example
>Suppose $M$ is the ${\bf Z}$-module ${\bf Z}_2$ and $f:M\to N$ is a ${\bf Z}$-module morphism to some ${\bf Q}$-module $N$.  Then $N$ is a ${\bf Q}$-vector space, so every nonzero element in $N$ has infinite additive order. Since both elements in $M$ have finite order, this implies their images in $N$ must be zero. In other words, every ${\bf Z}$-module morphism from $M$ to $N$ must be the zero map, and so there cannot be any embeddings of $M$ into a ${\bf Q}$-module.

## Category theory insight

In light of the second example, let's widen our scope and instead consider *all* $R$-module morphisms $f:M\to N$ where $N$ also has the structure of an $S$-module. Can we find a "best possible" $S$-module through which all $R$-module morphisms from $M$ factor? More formally, and still under the working assumption that $R$ is a subring of $S$, let $U:S-\textbf{Mod}\to R-\textbf{Mod}$ be the restriction of scalars functor described above. ^[This is really an example of a forgetful functor, since we are simply forgetting part of the $S$-action, hence our choice for the letter $U$.] We are ideally looking for a functor $T:R-\textbf{Mod}\to S-\textbf{Mod}$ that is adjoint to $U$, in that there is a natural bijection $$\operatorname{Hom}_S(T(M),N)\simeq \operatorname{Hom}_R(M,U(N)).$$
This looks very similar to the universal property of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/Free modules\|free module]], and so it is perhaps no surprise that the construction of the mystery module $T(M)$ is very similar to that of the free module. In fact, the free module construction will make a return shortly.

Before we move on to the actual construction, it's worthwhile to consider the choice we've made above, which is that we're specifically looking for a functor $T:R-\textbf{Mod}\to S-\textbf{Mod}$ that is left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U$ (the restriction of scalars functor). What about a functor that is right adjoint to $U$? It turns out such a functor also exists, and it is sometimes called the **co-extension of scalars**.

## The construction
{ #9374ca}


Given our $R$-module $M$ and the fact that we have an inclusion of rings $R\subseteq S$, our first step towards extending the $R$-action on $M$ is to look at the free ${\bf Z}$-module on the set $S\times M$.^[If we're being pedantic, we mean the set $U(S)\times U(M)$, where $U$ is the forgetful functor from $R-\textbf{Mod}\to \textbf{Se}$.] In this abelian group $F(S\times M)$ we then want to impose relations so that the quotient of this abelian group by the submodule generated by those relations has the structure of an $S$-module in which the $S$-action extends the $R$-action on $M$. To that end, let $H$ be the submodule of $F(S\times M)$ generated by all elements of the following form:
- $(s,m_1+m_2)-(s,m_1)-(s,m_2)$
- $(s_1+s_2,m)-(s_1,m)-(s_2,m)$
- $(sr,m)-(s,rm)$

for $s_i\in S$ and $m, m_i\in M$. Note that we are using the natural identification of the set $S\times M$ with a subset of $F(S\times M)$.

>[!note] A small but important note
>Although the free ${\bf Z}$-module $F(S\times M)$ is constructed from the sets of elements of $S$ and $M$ without knowledge of the algebraic structure (i.e., their internal operations), the subgroup $H$ defined above *does* use the information about their algebraic structures. The first bullet point uses the additive structure in $M$, the second uses the additive structure in $S$, and the third uses both the right $R$-module structure of S and the left $R$-module structure of $M$.

We denote the resulting quotient group by $S\otimes_R M$ and call it the **tensor product of $S$ and $M$ over $R$**. Note that by construction it "remembers" the left $R$-module structure of $M$ and right $R$-module structure of $S$.

It is common to let $s\otimes m$ denote the coset containing $(s,m)$ in the quotient group $S\otimes_R M$. Using this notation, every element in $S\otimes_R M$ can be written (non-uniquely!) as a finite sum of the form $\displaystyle\sum_i s_i\otimes m_i$. Elements that can be written simply as $s\otimes m$ are called **simple tensors** (or sometimes **pure tensors**).

In this new notation, our construction of $S\otimes_R M$ has forced the relations
- $s\otimes (m_1+m_2)=s\otimes m_1+s\otimes m_2$
- $(s_1+s_2)\otimes m = s_1\otimes m+s_2\otimes m$
- $sr\otimes m = s\otimes rm$

## The $S$-module structure on $S\otimes_R M$

We have constructed the abelian group $S\otimes_R M$ to have an obvious $S$-action:$$\displaystyle s\left(\sum s_i\otimes m_i\right) := \sum ss_i\otimes m$$
As with any action (or function) defined on a quotient group by a formula using a choice of coset representative, we should check that this action is well defined. In other words, we should really verify that for each $s\in S$ the map $f_s:F(S\times M)\to S\otimes_R F$ defined by $$\displaystyle f_s\left(\sum (s_i, m_i)\right) := \sum (ss_i,m_i)$$
is a morphism of abelian groups with $H\leq \ker(f)$. We'll leave [[Dummit, Foote - Abstract Algebra - 3e.pdf#page=374|the details]] for now and instead move on to various properties of the $S$-module $S\otimes_R M$ we have created.

## Properties of our construction

There is a (natural) $R$-module morphism $j:M\to U(S\otimes_R M)$ defined by $m\mapsto 1_S\otimes m$, where $U$ is the forgetful functor from $S-\textbf{Mod}$ to $R-\textbf{Mod}$. Since our tensor product involved taking a quotient group, it should not be expected that this morphism is injective. However, the module we created does possess the desired universal property, in that there is a natural bijection $$\displaystyle\operatorname{Hom}_S(S\otimes_R M, N)\simeq \operatorname{Hom}_R(M, U(N))$$
We'll add the details of this argument later, but for now we'll simply note that the construction follows from the universal property of the free ${\bf Z}$-module on $S\times M$, the universal property of quotient groups, and the fact that our subgroup $H$ of desired relations automatically is in the kernel of any module morphism to an $S$-module.

Here is a nice corollary of our universal property:

>[!summary] Corollary
> Let $j:M\to U(S\otimes_R M)$ be the $R$-module morphism defined above. Then $M/\ker(j)$ is the maximal quotient of $M$ that can be embedded into an $S$-module.

Why is this true? First observe that by the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/The Isomorphism Theorems for Modules#^feb9be\|First Isomorphism Theorem]] the quotient $M/\ker(j)$ is isomorphic to the image of $j$, which is $R$-submodule of $U(S\otimes_R M)$. Now suppose $N$ is an $S$-module and $f:M\to U(N)$ is an $R$-module morphism (and so $M/\ker(f)$ is isomorphic to a submodule of $N$).  By the universal property of the tensor product, we have a corresponding $S$-module morphism $g:S\otimes_R M\to N$; the natural bijection on the hom-sets also tells us that $f$ factors through $U(g)$ via $j$, i.e., we have a commutative diagram
<iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCJNIl0sWzEsMCwiVShTXFxvdGltZXNfUiBNKSJdLFsxLDEsIlUoTikiXSxbMSwyLCJVKGcpIl0sWzAsMiwiZiIsMl0sWzAsMSwiaiJdXQ==&embed" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none; display: block; margin: auto"></iframe>

This implies that $\ker(j)\subseteq \ker(f)$ as submodules of $M$, so by the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/The Isomorphism Theorems for Modules#^a050bb\|Isomorphism Theorems for Modules]] we have that $N/\ker(f)$ is a quotient of $N/\ker(j)$ (by the submodule $\ker(f)/\ker(j)$, specifically).

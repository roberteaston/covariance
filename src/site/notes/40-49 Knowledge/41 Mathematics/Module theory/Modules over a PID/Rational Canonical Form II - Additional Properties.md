> [!summary] Rational canonical form for linear transformations
> Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $F$, and let $T:V\to V$ be a linear endomorphism. Then there is a basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $V$ such that the matrix $\mathcal{M}(T;\mathcal{B})$ for $T$ with respect to the basis $\mathcal{B}$ is in rational canonical form.
>
> The rational canonical form for $T$ is unique.

> [!summary] Rational canonical form characterizes similarity
> Suppose $S,T:V\to V$ are linear endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional $F$-vector space $V$. Then the following are equivalent:
> 1. $S$ and $T$ are similar; i.e., there is a linear automorphism $C:V\to V$ such that $S=CTC^{-1}$;
> 2. $S$ and $T$ have the same rational canonical form; and
> 3. the $F[x]$-modules obtained from $V$ via $S$ and $T$ are isomorphic $F[x]$-modules.

In the above propositions, the same statements hold if "linear transformations" is replaced with $n\times n$ matrices over $F$, where $n=\dim_F(V)$.

> [!summary] Characteristic polynomials and invariant factors
> Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix over a field $F$. Then:
> 1. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is the product of the invariant factors of $A$;
> 2. (**The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem**) The minimal polynomial of $A$ divides the characteristic polynomial of $A$.
> 3. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ divides some power of the minimal polynomial of $A$.

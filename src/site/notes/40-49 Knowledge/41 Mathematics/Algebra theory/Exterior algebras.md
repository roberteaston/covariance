## Motivation
---

Suppose $V$ is an $n$-dimensional $k$-vector space and $\mathcal{B}=\{v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$ is basis for $V$. Since $V$ is the free $k$-module on the set $\{v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$, each linear transformation $T:V\to V$ corresponds to a unique choice of vectors $w_1,\ldots, w_n\in V$, namely the images of each of the basis vectors $v_i$. Moreover, the determinant is a function that assigns to $T$ a single value $\det(T)\in F$. With the basis $\mathcal{B}$ fixed, this determinant can be viewed as a function

$$\det:V\times \cdots \times V\to k$$

that assigns to each $n$-tuple $(w_1,\ldots, w_n)$ the determinant of the corresponding linear transformation.

This determinant function is characterized by three nice properties:
- It is alternating: If we swap the positions of two of the vectors in the $n$-tuple, the determinant changes sign.
- It is multilinear: If we fix all but one vector in the $n$-tuple, the resulting function $V\to k$ is $k$-linear.
- It is 1 on the identity transformation.

One immediate consequence of the first property is that if $w_i=w_j$ for any distinct $i, j$ then the determinant of that $n$-tuple is zero. Combined with the second property, it follows that the determinant of an $n$-tuple $(w_1,\ldots, w_n)$ is zero whenever the vectors are linearly dependent.

This alternating multilinear function seems like something very close to the tensor algebra or symmetric algebra construction. Let's begin by looking for an analogue of the tensor algebra for which we have the additional property that $m\cdot m=0$ for all $m\in M$.

## The construction
---

>[!note] Definition of exterior algebra
>Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with unity) and $M$ be an $R$-module. The **exterior algebra** of $M$ is the $R$-algebra obtained by taking the quotient of the tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}(M)$ by the ideal $\mathcal{A}(M)$ generated by all elements of the form $m\otimes m$ for $m\in M$. The exterior algebra $\mathcal{T}(M)/\mathcal{A}(M)$ is denoted $\bigwedge (M)$ and the image of $m_1\otimes m_2\otimes \cdots \otimes m_i$ in $\bigwedge (M)$ is denoted $m_1\wedge m_2\wedge \cdots \wedge m_i$.

As with the symmetric algebra, the ideal $\mathcal{A}(M)$ is generated by homogenous elements and hence is a graded ideal. It follows that $\bigwedge (M)$ is a graded ring and the homogeneous component of degree $k$ is

$$\bigwedge^{i} (M)=\mathcal{T}^i(M)/\mathcal{A}^i(M).$$

This $R$-module is called the **$i^{\text{th}}$ exterior power** of $M$. Note that since $\mathcal{A}(M)$ is generated (as an ideal) by degree 2 homogenous elements, we have $\mathcal{A}^0(M)=\mathcal{A}^1 (M) = 0$ and hence have $\bigwedge^0(M)=R$ and $\bigwedge^1(M)=M$.

> [!note] Notational note
> Anecdotally, it seems common to drop the parentheses when dealing with the exterior algebra, and instead write simply $\bigwedge M$ and $\bigwedge^i M$. Dummit & Foote does *not* do this, however, so I have stuck with the parentheses here. (It also matches our notation for the tensor and symmetric algebras.)

## The alternating property
---

The multiplication in $\bigwedge (M)$ is given by

$$(m_1\wedge \cdots \wedge m_i)\wedge (m_1'\wedge \cdots \wedge m_j')=m_1\wedge \cdots m_i\wedge m_1'\wedge \cdots \wedge m_j'.$$

This is called the **wedge** (or **exterior**) **product**.

This multiplication is alternating in the following sense. By construction, we have $m_1\wedge \cdots \wedge m_i = 0$ in $\bigwedge^i (M)$ whenever $m_i=m_{i+1}$ for any $i$. We claim that we then have anti-commutativity for simple wedges; i.e., for every $m, m'\in M$ we have

$$m\wedge m'=-(m'\wedge m).$$

To see this, observe that by construction we have

$$(m+m')\wedge (m+m')=0.$$

Expanding out the left-hand side gives

$$(m\wedge m)+(m\wedge m')+(m'\wedge m)+(m'\wedge m')=0.$$

The first and last wedges are zero by construction. The claim thus follows.

> [!warning] Warning
> This anti-commutativity does *not* extend to arbitrary products. For example,
> 
> $$\begin{align*} m\wedge (n_1\wedge n_2)&=(m\wedge n_1)\wedge n_2\\ &=-(n_1\wedge m)\wedge n_2\\ &= - n_1\wedge (m\wedge n_2)\\&= n_1\wedge (n_2\wedge m)\\ &=(n_1\wedge n_2)\wedge m.\end{align*}$$
> 
> So $m$ and $n_1\wedge n_2$ commute.

## A universal property of the exterior algebra
---

As with the tensor algebra and symmetric algebra functors, there is a functor from the category of $R$-modules to the category of those $R$-algebras $A$ with the property $a^2=0$ for all $a\in A$.

> [!summary] A universal property of the symmetric algebra
> Let $(R\text{-{\bf Alg}})_0$ be the category of $R$-algebras $A$ with the property that $a^2=0_A$ for every $a\in A$, and let $U:(R\text{-{\bf Alg}})_0\to R\text{-{\bf Mod}}$ be the forgetful functor. Then there is a functor $\bigwedge:R\text{-{\bf Mod}}\to (R\text{-{\bf Alg}})_0$ and a natural bijection
> 
> $$\tau_{M,A}:\operatorname{Hom}_{(R\text{-{\bf Alg}})_0}\left(\bigwedge (M),A\right)\xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Hom}_{R\text{-{\bf Mod}}}(M,U(A)).$$
> 
> In other words, the functor $\bigwedge$ is a left adjoint of the forgetful functor $U$.

One last time, as with the tensor algebra and symmetric algebra functors, we can now deduce many properties of $\bigwedge (M)$:
- It is an $R$-algebra (in which $a^2=0$ for all $a\in \bigwedge (M)$) that we can associate to the $R$-module $M$;
- The construction is functorial, so that if $f:M\to N$ is an $R$-module morphism then there is a corresponding $R$-algebra morphism $\bigwedge (f):\bigwedge (M)\to \bigwedge (N)$;
- The identity $R$-algebra morphism $\bigwedge (M)\to \bigwedge (M)$ corresponds to an $R$-module morphism $M\to U(\bigwedge (M))$. Classically, this is viewed as an inclusion $M\hookrightarrow \bigwedge (M)$ onto the degree 1 component. (This is a component of the unit of the adjunction.)
- Since $\bigwedge$ is a left adjoint it commutes with all colimits; in particular, it commutes with coproducts (which again are called direct sums in these categories).

## Examples
---

1. Suppose $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $k$ with basis $\{v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$. When $0\leq i\leq n$, the set of vectors
   
   $$\{v_{j_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge v_{j_i}\mid 1\leq j_1<\cdots < j_i\leq n\}$$
   
   is a basis for $\bigwedge^i (V)$. When $i>n$ the $R$-module $\bigwedge^i (V)$ is trivial.
   
   This same statement is true more generally when $R$ is a commutative ring and $M$ is a free $R$-module of rank $n$.

1. Continuing the previous example, suppose $\phi:V\to V$ is any linear endomorphism of $V$. For every $i$ we then have a $k$-linear transformation
   
   $$\bigwedge^i (\phi):\bigwedge^i(V)\to \bigwedge^i(V).$$
   
   When $i=n$, the $k$-vector space $\bigwedge^n (V)$ is one-dimensional with basis vector $v_1\wedge v_2\wedge \cdots \wedge v_n$ and
   
   $$\bigwedge^n(\phi)(v_1\wedge \cdots \wedge v_n)=\phi(v_1)\wedge \cdots  \wedge\phi(v_n) = D(\phi)\cdot (v_1\wedge \cdots v_n)$$
   
   for some scalar $D(\phi)\in k$. One can verify that this function $D$ satisfies the three axioms for a determinant function and hence $D(\phi)=\det(\phi)$.

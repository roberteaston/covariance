### The power set functor

One of the first constructions you usually see in set theory is that of the *power set*. Indeed, it is usually part of the very axioms of set theory. This construction is the object map of a functor. The **power set functor** $\mathcal{P}:{\bf Set}\to {\bf Set}$ is defined as follows:
- Objects: For each set $X$ we assign its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$, i.e., the set of all subsets of $X$
- Arrows: For each set map $f:X\to Y$, we assign the set map $\mathcal{P}f:\mathcal{P}(X)\to \mathcal{P}(Y)$ defined by sending a subset $S\subseteq X$ to its image $f(S)\subseteq Y$.
You should verify for yourself that these maps satisfy the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Functors#^a05956\|properties]] of a functor.

### Forgetful functors

A functor that simply "forgets" some or all of the structure of an algebraic object is commonly called a **forgetful** (or **underlying**) functor. For example, the forgetful functor $U:{\bf Grp}\to {\bf Set}$ assigns to each group $G$ the set $UG$ of its elements ("forgetting" the multiplication and hence the group structure), and assigns to each group homomorphism $f:G\to G'$ the same function $f$, regarded simply as a set map. Below are some other common forgetful functors:
- $U:{\bf Ab}\to {\bf Grp}$
- $U:{\bf Ab}\to {\bf Set}$
- $U:{\bf Ring}\to {\bf Ab}$
- $U:{\bf Top}\to {\bf Set}$
- $U:{\bf Field}\to {\bf Ring}$

### Remember me not

Are there functors inverse to "forgetting?" Sadly, we will see that the answer to that question is generally no: that which is forgotten cannot be remembered. However, we will also see that there is a type of functor which can be regarded as complementary to forgetting (later to be codified in the idea of an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Adjoints/Adjoints\|adjoint]]). 

For example, there is a functor $F:{\bf Set}\to {\bf Grp}$ that assigns to each set $X$ the so-called **free group** $FX$. This is the group whose elements are finite "words" with letters the elements $x\in X$ (along with their formal inverses), modulo an equivalence relation that equates the words $xx^{-1}$ and $x^{-1}x$ with the empty word (which is the identity for the group). The operation on this free group $FX$ is concatenation. An alternative name for this functor could be the "groupification" functor, since it creates a group from a given set.

Note that these two functors are definitely not inverses. For instance, even if $G$ is the trivial group (with a single element), the free group on the one-element set $UG$ is infinite. In other words, $F(U(G))\neq G$. So what is the relation between the functors $U$ and $F$? That is something we will explore in detail when we study [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Adjoints/Adjoints\|adjoint functors]].

### Abelianization
{ #0e69de}

Suppose $G$ is a group. For each pair of elements $x,y\in G$, the element $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ is called the commutator $[x,y]$ of $x$ and $y$ in $G$. Notice that this element is the identity exactly when the elements $x$ and $y$ commute. The subgroup generated by the set of all commutators in $G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, called the **commutator subgroup** and denoted $[G,G]$. You can verify the following facts:
1. $G/[G,G]$ is always an abelian group;
3. Any group morphism $G\to H$ carries commutators to commutators, hence $[G,G]$ to $[H,H]$
4. Every group morphism $G\to H$ to an abelian group $H$ factors uniquely through the projection $G\to G/[G,G]$
5. The assignment $G\mapsto G/[G,G]$ is the object function of a functor ${\bf Grp}\to {\bf Ab}$, called the **abelianization** functor (or sometimes **factor-commutator** functor).
The abelianization functor is actually [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Adjoints/Adjoints\|adjoint]] to the forgetful functor $U:\textbf{Ab}\to \textbf{Grp}$.

### A non-functor
Although nearly every common construction in algebra is the object function of a functor, there are a few notable exceptions. One such is the assignment to each group $G$ of its center $\operatorname{Z}(G)$. Intuitively, that is because a homomorphism $G\to H$ can carry an element in the center of $G$ to one not in the center of $H$, and hence we do *not* have an induced morphism $\operatorname{Z}(G)\to \operatorname{Z}(H)$. For additional details, check out [[10-19 Teaching/11 Classes/MATH 561 - Graduate Algebra/Exercises/There is no 'center' functor on Grp\|this exercise]].

## General linear group
For each commutative ring $R$, the set of all invertible $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $R$ is called **general linear group** $\operatorname{GL}_n(R)$. Moreover, for each ring morphism $R\to S$ between commutative rings there is a natural map that takes each matrix with entries in $R$ to a  matrix with entries in $S$ (by simply applying the ring morphism on each entry of the matrix). You can also verify that this map sends invertible matrices with entries in $R$ to invertible matrices with entries in $S$, and in fact is a group morphism $\operatorname{GL}_n(R)\to \operatorname{GL}_n(S)$. Convince yourself that this defines a functor $\operatorname{GL}_n:{\bf CRing}\to {\bf Grp}$.

### Unit groups
This example is [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Examples of natural transformations#^c9052c\|closely related]] to the previous. For each ring $R$, the set of (multiplicative) units in $R$ forms a group $R^{\times}$, and since ring homomorphisms preserve units we have for each ring homomorphism $R\to S$ an induced group homomorphism $R^{\times}\to S^{\times}$. Convince yourself again this defines a functor $\bullet^{\times}:{\bf Ring}\to {\bf Grp}$. We similarly have a functor $\bullet^{\times}:{\bf CRing}\to {\bf Ab}$.

### Examples in topology
Singular homology in a given dimension $n$ assigns to each topological space $X$ an abelian group $\operatorname{H}_n(X)$, and also to each continuous map $X\to Y$ a group morphism $\operatorname{H}_n(X)\to \operatorname{H}_n(Y)$. If you are familiar with homology, you should convince yourself this defines a functor $\operatorname{H}_n:{\bf Top}\to {\bf Ab}$.

Similarly, the assignment of a homotopy group $\pi_n(X,x)$ to each pointed topological space is (the object function of) a functor $\pi_n:{\bf Top}_*\to {\bf Grp}$. Alternatively, it's possible to defined a functor on $\textbf{Top}$ that assigns to each topological space its **fundamental groupoid**.

### Families of objects in a category

Suppose $C$ is any category and $S$ is any set. A **family of objects in $C$ indexed by $S$** is, as it sounds, a collection of the form $\{c_s\in C\mid s\in S\}$. We can equivalently package this information in the form of a functor. Let $\textbf{S}$ denote the discrete category on $S$, i.e., the category whose objects are the elements of $S$ and that only has identity arrows. A functor $F:\textbf{S}\to C$ is then exactly the information of a set map (usually also denoted $F$) from the set $S$ to the set of objects of $C$; indeed, the arrow function of $F$ is completed fixed, since $\textbf{S}$ only contains identity arrows $1_s$ for each $s\in S$ and we must have $F(1_s)=1_{F(s)}$ for all $s\in S$.

For example, the set of objects of $C$ is in (natural) bijection with the set of functors $\textbf{1}\to C$, while the set of pairs of objects in $C$ is in (natural) bijection with the set of functors $\textbf{S}\to C$, where $\textbf{S}$ is the discrete category on the set $\{1,2\}$.

In general, we have a (natural) bijection $$\operatorname{Hom}_{\textbf{Set}}(S,\operatorname{Ob}(C))\simeq \operatorname{Hom}_{\textbf{Cat}}(\textbf{S},C).$$
This allows us to interchangeably think of families of objects in a given category $C$ as either collections of objects in $C$ indexed by $S$, or functors from the discrete category $\textbf{Set}$ to $C$.

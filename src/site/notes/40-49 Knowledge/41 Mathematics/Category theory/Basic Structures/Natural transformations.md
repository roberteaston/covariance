# Definition

Have you ever been reading a math textbook (or even these notes!) and come across the phrase "there is a natural map" or "there is a natural isomorphism" and wondered if there was a precise meaning to the use of the word "natural"? If so, the answer is yes and it is codified in the idea of a *natural transformation*.

>[!note] Definition of natural transformation
>Suppose $C$ and $D$ are categories and $F,G:C\to D$ are two functors between those categories. A **natural transformation** $\tau: F\Rightarrow G$ is a function that assigns to each object $c\in C$ an arrow $\tau_c:Fc\to Gc$ in $D$ such that for every arrow $f:c\to c'$ in $C$ one has the following commutative diagram in $D$:

A natural transformation is often called a **morphism of functors**. It can also be viewed as a way to compare the images of two functors, since it directly connects every image of one functor $F$ with the image (of the same object) of another functor $G$; the naturality condition guarantees that these comparisons are compatible with arrow composition.

# Examples

## The determinant

Let $R$ be a commutative ring. For each $n\times n$ matrix $M$ with entries in $R$, the determinant of $M$ is an element in $R$. Moreover, we have the following classic facts of linear algebra:
1. $M$ is invertible exactly when its determinant is a unit; and
2. The determinant function is multiplicative
It follows that the determinant is a group morphism $\operatorname{GL}_n(R)\to R^{\times}$. Since this function ostensibly depends on the ring $R$, we should denote it $\det_R:\operatorname{GL}_n(R)\to R^{\times}$. However, it is common to simply denote the determinant function by $\det$, usually with the acknowledgement that the formula for the determinant is "the same for every ring." The precise meaning of this is that for every ring morphism $f:R\to S$ we have the following commutative diagram in ${\bf Grp}$:

This exactly says that $\det:\operatorname{GL}_n\Rightarrow \bullet^{\times}$ is a natural transformation between two functors $\textbf{CRing}\to \textbf{Grp}$.{ #c9052c}

## Abelianization and forgetting

For each group $G$ the projection $\pi_G:G\to G/[G,G]$ defines a transformation from the identity functor on $\textbf{Grp}$ to the abelianization-forgetful composition functor $\textbf{Grp}\to \textbf{Ab}\to\textbf{Grp}$. This transformation is natural, since for every group morphism $f:G\to H$ you can check that the diagram below commutes:

## Free vector spaces and "insertion of generators"

Let $k$ be a field. For each set $X$, the *free $F$-vector space on $X$* is the vector space $F(X)$ generated by the elements of $x$. It consists of all formal finite $k$-linear combinations of elements in $X$, i.e., it consists of sums of the form $\displaystyle \sum_{x\in X} c_x x$ where $c_x\in k$. One can show that this defines the object function of a functor $F:\textbf{Set}\to \textbf{Vec}_k$.

Let $U:\textbf{Vec}_k\to \textbf{Set}$ be the usual forgetful functor and consider the composition $UF:\textbf{Set}\to \textbf{Set}$. This composition sends each set $X$ to the set of elements of the vector space $F(X)$. There is evidently a set map $i:X\to UF(X)$ that sends each element $x\in X$ to the same element in $F(X)$, only now considered as a formal linear combination of the elements of $X$ (that just happens not to involve any of the other elements). This map is sometimes called the *insertion of generators*. It is immediate to verify this defines a natural transformation from the identity functor on $\textbf{Set}$ to the composition $UF$.

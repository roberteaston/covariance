## Motivation

Given two $R$-modules $M$ and $N$, the $R$-module $M\otimes_R N$ was created to satisfy the universal property that captures the idea of being able to multiply elements in $M$ with elements in $N$. In the special case $M=N$, the module $M\otimes_R M$ gives us a way to compute products of elements in $M$. It doesn't quite give us a ring structure on $M$, however, since it doesn't allow us to multiply together more than two elements in $M$. Can we amplify our tensor product construction to obtain a module with a full ring structure, capturing the desire of layering a multiplicative operation on the $R$-module $M$?

## The desired universal property

With the above motivation in mind, we are looking for a functor from the category of $R$-modules to the category of $R$-algebras that is "free" in the same sense as the free $R$-module construction on a set $S$; i.e., that is left adjoint to the corresponding forgetful functor.

>[!summary] (Primary) Universal property of the tensor algebra
>Let $U:R-\textbf{Alg}\to R-\textbf{Mod}$ be the forgetful functor from the category of $R$-algebras to the category of $R$-modules. Then there is functor $\mathcal{T}:R-\textbf{Mod}\to R-\textbf{Alg}$ together with a natural bijection
>$$\operatorname{Hom}_{R-\textbf{Alg}}(\mathcal{T}(M),A)\xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Hom}_{R-\textbf{Mod}}(M,U(A)).$$
>In other words, the functor $\mathcal{T}$ is a left adjoint of the forgetful functor $U$.

Even without having seen the construction yet, such a property gives us a way to think about $\mathcal{T}(M)$:
- It is an $R$-algebra that we can associate to the $R$-module $M$;
- The construction is functorial, so that if $f:M\to N$ is an $R$-module morphism then there is a corresponding $R$-algebra morphism $\mathcal{T}f:\mathcal{T}(M)\to \mathcal{T}(N)$;
- $R$-algebra morphisms $\mathcal{T}(M)\to A$ are in natural bijection with $R$-module morphisms $M\to U(A)$. As a special case:
	- The identity $R$-algebra morphism $\mathcal{T}(M)\to \mathcal{T}(M)$ corresponds to an $R$-module morphism $M\to U(\mathcal{T(M)})$.
- Since $\mathcal{T}$ is a left adjoint it commutes with all colimits; in particular, it commutes with coproducts.
## The construction

>[!note] Definition of tensor algebra
>Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring (with unity) and $M$ is an $R$-module. Set $\mathcal{T}^0(M)=R$ and for each positive integer $k$ define the **$k^{\text{th}}$ tensor power of $M$** to be the $R$-module
>$$\mathcal{T}^k(M)=\underbrace{M\otimes_R M\otimes_R \cdots \otimes_R M}_{k\text{ times}}.$$
>The elements of $\mathcal{T}^k(M)$ are called **$k$-tensors**.
>
>Then define the **tensor algebra** of $M$ to be the $R$-module
>$$\mathcal{T}(M)=\bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty}\mathcal{T}^k(M).$$
>Every element of $\mathcal{T}(M)$ is a finite formal linear combination of $k$-tensors.

As the name implies, the $R$-module $\mathcal{T}(M)$ has a (natural) structure of an $R$-[[40-49 Knowledge/41 Subject notes/Algebra theory/Algebras\|algebra]]. The multiplication on simple tensors is defined by concatenation of tensors:
$$(m_1\otimes\cdots \otimes m_i)\cdot (m_1'\otimes\cdots \otimes m_j'):=m_1\otimes\cdots \otimes m_i\otimes m_i'\otimes\cdots \otimes m_j'.$$
The multiplication on sums of tensors is defined via the distributive laws. Note that this multiplication satisfies $\mathcal{T}^i(M)\mathcal{T}^j(M)\subseteq \mathcal{T}^{i+j}(M)$. In other words, the tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}(M)$ has the structure of a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Subject notes/Ring theory/Graded rings\|graded ring]].

It's worth noting that, as a ring, the tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}(M)$ is generated by the elements of $\mathcal{T}^0(M)=R$ and $\mathcal{T}^1(M)=M$.

At some point we should verify that this construction satisfies the desired universal property. For now, however, let's look at some examples.
### Examples

1. Let $R={\bf Z}$ and $M={\bf Q}/{\bf Z}$. One can verify that ${\bf Q}/{\bf Z}\otimes_{\bf Z} {\bf Q}/{\bf Z}\simeq 0$, and so the tensor algebra is simply
   $$\mathcal{T}({\bf Q}/{\bf Z})\simeq {\bf Z}\oplus ({\bf Q}/{\bf Z}).$$
   We can also unwind the multiplication rule. Let's look at a specific example. Two elements in ${\bf Z}\oplus ({\bf Q}/{\bf Z})$ are $2\oplus \left[\frac{1}{3}\right]$ and $3\oplus \left[\frac{4}{5}\right]$. When we add these two elements we get the element
   $$(2+3)\oplus \left[\frac{1}{3}+\frac{4}{5}\right]=5\oplus \left[\frac{17}{15}\right] = 5\oplus \left[\frac{2}{15}\right].$$
   Notice that this is not what we would get conventionally by adding the rational numbers $(2+\frac{1}{3})+(3+\frac{4}{5})=6+\frac{2}{15}$.
   
   When we multiply these two elements we get the element
   $$\begin{align*}
   \left(2\oplus\left[\frac{1}{3}\right]\right)\otimes \left(3\oplus\left[\frac{4}{5}\right]\right)&=(2\cdot 3)\oplus \left(2\cdot\left[\frac{4}{5}\right]+3\cdot\left[\frac{1}{3}\right]\right)\oplus\left(\left[\frac{1}{3}\right]\otimes \left[\frac{4}{5}\right]\right)\\
   &=6\oplus \left[\frac{13}{5}\right]\oplus 0\\
   &= 6\oplus\left[\frac{3}{5}\right].
   \end{align*}$$
2. Let $R={\bf Z}$ and $M={\bf Z}_n$. One can verify that ${\bf Z}_n\otimes_{\bf Z} {\bf Z}_n\simeq {\bf Z}_n$, and so the tensor algebra is
   $$\mathcal{T}({\bf Z}_n)\simeq {\bf Z}\oplus {\bf Z}_n\oplus {\bf Z}_n\oplus \cdots\simeq {\bf Z}[x]/(nx).$$
   For that final isomorphism, the correspondence is that each finite formal sum $c_0\oplus [c_1]\oplus [c_2]\oplus \cdots$ maps to the coset represented by the polynomial $c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+\cdots$.

3. Suppose $R=F$ is a field and $V$ is a finite-dimensional $F$-vector space. Let $\mathcal{B}=\{v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$ be a basis for $V$ as an $F$-vector space. Then a basis for the $F$-vector space $\mathcal{T}^k(V)$ is
   $$\{v_{i_1}\otimes v_{i_2}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_{i_k}\mid v_{i_j}\in \mathcal{B}\}.$$
   (When $k=0$, the basis is simply $\{1\}$.) In particular, $\mathcal{T}^k(V)$ is an $F$-vector space of dimension $n^k$.

> [!warning] Unfunded and inactive
> This award effectively ran out of funds in 2022. That fact wasn't discovered until winner for 2023 (Joel Anderson) had already been chosen. To cover that mistake, money was used from the [[30-39 Service/31 Department service/Scholarship Committee/01 Awards/Charles J. Hanks\|Hanks Scholarship]] to cover the award.
## Description
---
The following appears underneath the corresponding plaque in the Math Department:

> [!quote]
> The Annual Cal Poly Mathematics Department Award for Excellence in Mathematics was initiated in 1973 by an anonymous donation.
> 
> Each year since that time, Dr. and Mrs. Charles Hanks have very generously matched all donations earmarked for this award.
> 
> In 1988, the Mathematics faculty voted to change the name of the award to the Charles J. Hanks Award for Excellence in Mathematics to reflect the department's appreciation of the financial and administrative support given by Dr. Hanks.
> 
> The award is presented to a student who has demonstrated excellence and outstanding ability.

This scholarship was established in 2007 by Carol S. Judd, in honor of her husband, W. Boyd Judd, who was a faculty member in our department from 1956 until his retirement in 1981. I have yet to track down extensive info about Boyd, but I did find [Carol's obituary](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sanluisobispo/name/carol-judd-obituary?id=9696685), most of which is recreated below.

### Carol Judd Obituary

Carol Judd, a living legend to many and the candy lady to SLO residents, passed away on April 27, 2018, at the age of 101 (or, as she put it, 69) with loved ones in attendance. Having beaten the odds by surviving challenges that would have felled many, it took the combined forces of cancer and multi-system failure to take out this mighty force of nature.

Carol was born during a Christmas snowstorm on a farm in rural South Dakota as the youngest child of Ben and Clara Selke. The family worked the farm for many years before moving to Brookings where Carol eventually went to college and worked in the clerical field. The austerity and hardship of her early years helped form her fierce independence, survival instinct, and determination to overcome any obstacle that life threw at her.

Carol married John Neil "Jack" Pengelly, a Navy man. Together they had two surviving children and lived in a number of states before his death.

She married her second husband W. Boyd Judd, in 1954 in the Bay Area. They added one more child to the family and moved to San Luis Obispo in 1957 after Boyd secured a position as professor in the Mathematics department at Cal Poly. For many years, Carol was an active member of the Cal Poly Women's Club, serving as a board officer and editing their newsletter for 28 years. Carol worked in the clerical and accounting field, at CMC and for the County of San Luis Obispo. She was a devoted wife and mother, sponsoring a Camp Fire Girls group for a period of time as well as other activities to support her children. She was very proud of her children and grandchildren. Carol was determined, headstrong, independent, curious, and full of vitality.

She dearly loved to travel. She and Boyd enjoyed traveling throughout the country. She also traveled extensively abroad with him, alone, and with her youngest daughter Anita. After Boyd's passing in 1999, Carol and Anita enjoyed multiple international travel adventures and both have visited all seven continents, a feat they accomplished together when they set their feet on the continent of Antarctica at the exact same moment.

Her spirit of independence continued all the way to her final days, as she proudly maintained her independent lifestyle in her home of 61 years along with her beloved cat Rosie. Carol was a devoted member of the United Methodist Church of San Luis Obispo and greatly enjoyed the friendships she formed there. She bragged that she joined the church when it was originally located in the center of town. She loved the new church built on the hill and was saddened when it burnt down. When the church was rebuilt, she was proud to dedicate a bible to the church.

With a love of music, she was a member of the hand bell choir the Bel Canto Ringers. She also played autoharp in their church band Week Beginnings. In her mid-90's she was inspired by her friend to take up the harp and played Silent Night as a Christmas gift to the congregation. Carol was a kind and selfless person, continually making sacrifices in service to others. She volunteered at French Hospital for over 25 years, served as a president of the volunteer guild and edited the French Connection. At 101, she was their oldest volunteer. She crocheted baby blankets for newborns. She greatly enjoyed her volunteer "family" and formed many friendships with the French Hospital staff as well. Her "family" extended throughout the city as she looked for ways to make a difference.

She established six scholarships in the Judd name -- two at Cal Poly, three at Cuesta College and one at French Hospital.

Carol loved to share laughter and joy with others, whether it was through a funny story, a joke, or a gift of candy. She was known to carry a stash of chocolates in her purse to share with people she met throughout her day. She loved the moments of smiles, laughter, and delight that connect our hearts.

Carol is survived by her three daughters: Laurice Penny Sommers (Doug), Christie Redd Coyes (Mike), and Anita Judd (Bruce). She was preceded in death by all of her immediate family: her brothers and sister; her first husband, Jack Pengelly; her second husband, W. Boyd Judd; her son, Joseph Pengelly; and her two grand- children: Lacey Tanner Redd and Todd Jeffrey Redd.

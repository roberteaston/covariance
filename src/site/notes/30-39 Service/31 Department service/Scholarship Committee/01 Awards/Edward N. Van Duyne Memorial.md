## Description
---

This scholarship has a large endowment and can be split among many students (up to a maximum of 21) with a variable award amount. There are no official requirements, but a 3.0+ GPA is recommended.

Informally, the Scholarship Committee tends to choose recipients that did not receive other substantial scholarships, and to assign individual scholarship amounts in value "tiers".

## Description

> [!quote] Description in AMS email
> Each year, the American Mathematical Society selects institutional members of the Society at random to award $3,000 to undergraduate students majoring in mathematics. I am pleased to inform you that your department has been chosen to name a student to receive one of the Undergraduate Opportunity Awards for the 2024–2025 academic year.
> 
> The Trjitzinsky Award is funded by a 1988 bequest in memory of [Waldemar J. Trjitzinsky](https://www.ams.org/programs/students/Trjitzinsky_bio.pdf "https://www.ams.org/programs/students/Trjitzinsky_bio.pdf") and is intended to assist students who lack adequate financial resources and may be in danger of not completing their degree program in mathematics for financial reasons. In nominating a recipient for this award, the AMS encourages and welcomes institutions to name recipients who reflect the diversity of the mathematical community. Although it is not a condition of the award, we encourage departments to provide partial matching funds and to publicize the award within the local scholarly community. We strongly discourage splitting the award.
> 
> The AMS is happy to join with your department in nurturing mathematical talent through the Waldemar J. Trjitzinsky Memorial Fund, making an investment in the future of mathematics.


This is a one-time award and is paid directly by the AMS. The department had some one-time money to put in $1000 matching, making this award worth $4000 in total.

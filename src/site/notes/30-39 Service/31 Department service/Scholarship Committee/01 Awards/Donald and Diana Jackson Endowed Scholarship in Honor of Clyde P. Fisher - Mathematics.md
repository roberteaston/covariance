> [!quote] Description in Cal Poly Scholarships system
> The Donald and Diane Jackson Endowed Scholarship in Honor of Clyde P. Fisher recognizes Undergraduate or Graduate Mathematics or Physics majors who demonstrate successful academic progress with a minimum 3.0 GPA. Preference is for students who demonstrate financial need. To rotate annually between Math and Physics.

This scholarship is awarded to a student meeting the following criteria:
- has a current GPA of at least 3.0
- has financial need

Technically, the second criterion above is only a preference, but in practice it is usually treated as a requirement.

Also, we (the Math Dept) seem to be giving out this award yearly, so I'm not sure about the "rotate annually between Math and Physics" part ...

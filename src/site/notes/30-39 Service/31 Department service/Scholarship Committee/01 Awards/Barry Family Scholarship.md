This scholarship was established in 2016 by Alexis D. and Tyler M. Barry. Alexis and Tyler were both Cal Poly MATH majors who graduated in the mid-2000s. In fact, a search in PolyProfile reveals that Tyler Barry was a student from 2001-2005 and a star MATH major, earning straight A's throughout. I haven't been able to track down Alexis's information yet, mainly because I don't know her maiden name. (Her middle name appears to be Downing, though.) The Barry's currently live in San Diego.

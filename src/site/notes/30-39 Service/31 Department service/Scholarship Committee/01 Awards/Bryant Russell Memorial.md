## Donor info
---

This award was established in 1996 by the parents of Bryant Russell. I believe Bryant's mother may be Clair Russell, a retired teacher who graduated from Cal Poly in 1980 with a B.A. in Liberal Studies, Elementary Education and Teaching, and then went on to teaching at an elementary school in Ripon, CA until her retirement in 2014. I have yet to find information about what happened to Bryant.

> [!quote] Description in Cal Poly Scholarships system
> Edward Van Duyne Memorial Scholarship Endowment supports students majoring in Mathematics with a recommended 3.0 or better GPA.

This scholarship has a large endowment and can be split among many students (usually around 20 or more) with a variable award amount. There are no official requirements, but a 3.0+ GPA is recommended.

Informally, the Scholarship Committee tends to choose recipients that did not receive other substantial scholarships, and to assign individual scholarship amounts in value "tiers".

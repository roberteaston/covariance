## Donor info
---

This award was established in 2019 by emeritus professor Todor Todorov to encourage more students to write theses as part of their graduate work. Since most students donâ€™t finish their work before this banquet (not looking at anyone in particular here), this award is given for the best thesis turned in by the end of the previous year.

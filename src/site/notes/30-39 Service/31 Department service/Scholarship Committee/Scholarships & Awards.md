Welcome to the unofficial wiki for all things related to scholarships and awards connected to the Department of Mathematics at Cal Poly.

## Recent statistics
---

For the 2023-2024 academic year, there were:
- 17 scholarships, consisting of 75 recipients receiving a total value of $193,000
- 11 awards, consisting of 16 recipients receiving a total value of $9,200
- 240 students were eligible for at least one award, 144 of which had a GPA of at least 3.25
- 49 eligible students with financial need, 36 of which had a GPA of at least 2.75

## Important points

### Scholarships vs. Awards

There are two types of awards, confusingly called **scholarships** and **awards**. The former is applied directly to tuition costs and so can only be awarded to returning students; the latter is a cash award to be used however the student desires. In my personal opinion, these should probably be called “scholarship awards” and “non-scholarship awards”, but the bizarre convention seems to be to simply call these “scholarships” and “awards.”

### Different awards with the same name

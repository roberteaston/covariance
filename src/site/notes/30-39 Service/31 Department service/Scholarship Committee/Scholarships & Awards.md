## Important points

### Scholarships vs. Awards

There are two types of awards, confusingly called **scholarships** and **awards**. The former is applied directly to tuition costs and so can only be awarded to returning students; the latter is a cash award to be used however the student desires. In my personal opinion, these should probably be called “scholarship awards” and “non-scholarship awards”, but the bizarre convention seems to be to simply call these “scholarships” and “awards.”

### Different awards with the same name

The [Bailey College of Science and Mathematics](https://www.calpoly.edu/bailey-college-of-science-and-mathematics) holds an annual awards banquet at which it recognizes specific awards from each department within the college. Specifically, it recognizes:
- a single [[30-39 Service/31 Department service/Scholarship Committee/01 Awards/Academic Excellence (College)\|Academic Excellence]] award recipient for each major
- a single [[30-39 Service/31 Department service/Scholarship Committee/01 Awards/Community Leadership (College)\|Community Leadership]] award recipient for each department.
- a single [[30-39 Service/31 Department service/Scholarship Committee/01 Awards/Outstanding Graduate Student (College)\|Outstanding Graduate Student]] award recipient for each department

Although the selection of the above awards is entirely up to the department, the college is firm on only allowing a single recipient for each award. Because of this, the recipients of the above awards will sometimes deviate from the recipients of the department-level awards with the same names.

Let $a, b \in {\bf R}$ and $T: {\bf R}^3 \to {\bf R}^3$ be the linear transformation that is orthogonal projection onto the plane $z=ax+by$ (with respect to the usual Euclidean inner-product on ${\bf R}^3$).

1. Find the eigenvalues of $T$ and bases for the corresponding eigenspaces.
2. Is $T$ diagonalizable? Justify.
3. What is the characteristic polynomial of $T$?

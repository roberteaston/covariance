Consider the following matrix:

$$A=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}.$$

1. Determine the characteristic and minimal polynomials of $A$.
2. Find a basis for ${\bf R}^4$ consisting of generalized eigenvectors of $A$.
3. Find an invertible matrix $S$ such that $S^{-1}AS$ is in Jordan canonical form.
4. Determine a Jordan canonical form of $A$.

Let $a,b\in {\bf R}$ and $T:{\bf R}^3\to {\bf R}^3$ be the linear transformation which is reflection across the plane $z=ax+by$.

1. Find the eigenvalues of $T$ and for each find a basis for the corresponding eigenspace.
2. Is $T$ diagonalizable? Justify.
3. What is the characteristic polynomial of $T$?
4. What is the minimal polynomial of $T$?

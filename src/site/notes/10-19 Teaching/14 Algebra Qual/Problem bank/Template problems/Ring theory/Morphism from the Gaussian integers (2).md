Let $i\in {\bf C}$ be the usual root of unity, with $i^2=-1$, and let ${\bf Z}[i]=\{a+bi\mid a,b\in {\bf Z}\}$ be the ring of Gaussian integers.
1. Prove that there exists a (nonzero) ring homomorphism ${\bf Z}[i]\to {\bf Z}_5$.
2. Compute the kernel of your homomorphism explicitly, and state the conclusion given by the First Isomorphism Theorem.

Let ${\bf F}_9$ denote the field of nine elements.
1. Show that each nonzero $a\in {\bf F}_9$ is a root of $X^3-1=(X-1)(X^2+1)(X^4+1)\in {\bf F}_3[X]$.
2. Use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove that ${\bf F}_9$ has an element of multiplicative order 8. (Include a proof that the Pigeonhole Principle applies.)

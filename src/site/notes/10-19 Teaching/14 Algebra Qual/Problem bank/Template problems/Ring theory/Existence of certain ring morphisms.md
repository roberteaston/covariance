Let ${\bf Z}[i]=\{a+bi\,\mid \, a,b\in {\bf Z},\, i^2=-1\}$, a subring of ${\bf C}$. Prove there is no ring homomorphism ${\bf Z}[i]\to {\bf Z}_{19}$, but there is a ring homomorphism ${\bf Z}[i]\to {\bf Z}_{13}$. Note a ring homomorphism of commutative rings with $1$ must send $1$ to $1$.

*Hint:* The group of units in ${\bf Z}_{19}$ is the cyclic group $U(19)$ of order 18, and the group of units in ${\bf Z}_{13}$ is the cyclic group $U(13)$ of order 12.

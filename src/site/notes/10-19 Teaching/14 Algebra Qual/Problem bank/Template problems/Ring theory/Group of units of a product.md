Let ${\bf Z}_n$ be the ring of integers $\pmod{n}$. There is a ring homomorphism

$$\begin{align*} {\bf Z}_{28}&\to {\bf Z}_4\times {\bf Z}_7\\ [m]_{28}&\mapsto ([m]_4,[m]_7)\end{align*}$$

This is an isomorphism by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let ${\bf Z}_n^{\times}$ be the group of units of ${\bf Z}_n$. Prove that ${\bf Z}_{28}^{\times}$ is isomorphic to ${\bf Z}_4^{\times}\times {\bf Z}_7^{\times}$.

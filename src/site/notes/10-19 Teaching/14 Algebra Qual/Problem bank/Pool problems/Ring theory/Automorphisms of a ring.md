Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$, and $\sigma:R\to R$ be a ring automorphism.
1. Show that $F=\{r\in R\mid \sigma(r)=r\}$ is a subring of $R$ (with $1$).
2. Show that if $\sigma^2$ is the identity map on $R$, then each element of $R$ is the root of a monic polynomial of degree 2 in $F[x]$, where $F$ is as in (a).

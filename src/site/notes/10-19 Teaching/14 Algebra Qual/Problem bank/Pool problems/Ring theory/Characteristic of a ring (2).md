1. Prove that for every commutative ring with unity, $R$, there is a unique ring homomorphism $\phi_R: {\bf Z}\to R$, and that $\ker(\phi_R)=\langle d_R\rangle$ for some unique nonnegative integer $d_R$. The number $d_R$ is called the **characteristic** of $R$ and is denoted $\operatorname{char}(R)$.
2. Suppose $F_1$ and $F_2$ are fields for which there exists a ring homomorphism $f:F_1\to F_2$. Prove that $\operatorname{char}(F_1)=\operatorname{char}(F_2)$.

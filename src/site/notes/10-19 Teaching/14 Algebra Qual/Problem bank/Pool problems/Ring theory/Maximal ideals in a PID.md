Suppose $R$ is a PID (principal ideal domain). Prove that an ideal $I\subset R$ is maximal if and only if $I=\langle p\rangle$ for a prime $p\in R$. (By definition, an element $p$ is **prime** if whenever $p\mid ab$ then $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$. If you use the fact that prime implies irreducible, you have to prove it.)

Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers and let $A\in {\bf R}^{3\times 3}$ with each diagonal entry equal to $a$ and each off-diagonal entry equal to $b$.
1. Determine all eigenvalues and representative eigenvectors of $A$ together with their algebraic multiplicities. (*Hint:* $A=(a-b)I+bJ$ where $J$ is the $3\times 3$ matrix each of whose entries equals $1$.)
2. Is $A$ diagonalizable? Justify your answer.
3. Determine the minimal polynomial of $A$.

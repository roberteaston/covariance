Let $A$ be a real $n\times n$ matrix and let $A^{\top}$ denote its transpose.

1. Prove that $(A{\bf v})\cdot {\bf w}= {\bf v}\cdot (A^{\top}{\bf w})$ for all vectors ${\bf v},{\bf w}\in {\bf R}^n$. *Hint:* Recall that the dot product ${\bf u}\cdot {\bf v}$ equals the matrix product ${\bf u}^{\top}{\bf v}$.
2. Suppose now $A$ is also symmetric, i.e., that $A^{\top} = A$. Also suppose ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf w}$ are eigenvectors of $A$ with different eigenvalues. Prove that ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf w}$ are orthogonal.

1. Give an explicit example (with proof) showing that the union of two subspaces (of a given vector space) is not necessarily a subspace.
2. Suppose $U_1$ and $U_2$ are subspaces of a vector space $V$. Recall that their **sum** is defined to be the set $U_1+U_2 =\left\{u_1+u_2\,\mid \, u_1\in U_1, u_2\in U_2\right\}$. Prove $U_1+U_2$ is a subspace of $V$ containing $U_1$ and $U_2$.

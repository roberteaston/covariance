Let $G$ be a group and suppose $H\leq G$. The **normalizer** of $H$ in $G$ is defined to be $N(H)=\{g\in G\,|\, gH=Hg\}$ and the **centralizer** of $H$ in $G$ is defined to be $C(H)=\{g\in G\,|\,  gh=hg\text{ for all }h\in H\}$.

1. Prove that $N(H)$ is a subgroup of $G$.
2. Prove that $C(H)$ is a normal subgroup of $N(H)$ and that $N(H)/C(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(H)$.

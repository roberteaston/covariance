Let ${\bf Z}_n$ denote the cyclic group of order $n$. Suppose $m\in {\bf N}$ is relatively prime to $n$. Define the function $\mu_m:{\bf Z}_n\to {\bf Z}_n$ by $\mu_m[a]_n=[ma]_n$.

1. Prove that the map $\mu_m$ is a well-defined automorphism of ${\bf Z}_n$.
2. Prove that any automorphism of ${\bf Z}_n$ has the form $\mu_m$ for some $m$.

Suppose $G_1$ and $G_2$ are groups, with identity elements $e_1$ and $e_2$, respectively. Prove that if $\phi:G_1\to G_2$ is a homomorphism^[The version of this problem that appeared on the Spring 2019 exam assumed $\phi$ was an isomorphism, but that assumption was unnecessarily strong.], then $\phi(e_1)=e_2$.

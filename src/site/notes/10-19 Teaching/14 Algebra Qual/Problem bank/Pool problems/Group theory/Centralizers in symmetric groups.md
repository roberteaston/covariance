For a group $G$ and an element $g\in G$, the **centralizer** of $g$ in $G$ is the subgroup

$$C_G(g)=\{h\in G:hgh^{-1}=g\}.$$

We say $g$ and $g’$ are **conjugate in $G$** if there exists an element $h\in G$ such that $g’=hgh^{-1}$.

Suppose $S_n$ is a symmetric group with $n\geq 4$, and $\sigma$ is one of the $(n-2)$-cycles in $S_n$. (There are $\frac{n!}{2(n-2)}$ such cycles.)
1. Prove that $[S_n:C_{S_n}(\sigma)]=[A_n:C_{A_n}(\sigma)]$.
2. Determine whether all $(n-2)$-cycles are conjugate in $A_n$.

Let $V=\{a_0+a_1\sqrt[3]{2}+a_2\sqrt[3]{4}\mid a_0, a_1, a_2\in {\bf Q}\}\subseteq {\bf R}$. This set is a vector space over ${\bf Q}$.

1. Verify $V$ is closed under product (using the usual product operation in ${\bf R}$).
2. Let $T:V\to V$ be the linear transformation defined by $T(v)=(\sqrt[3]{2}+\sqrt[3]{4}) v$. Find the matrix that represents $T$ with respect to the basis $\{1,\sqrt[3]{2},\sqrt[3]{4}\}$ for $V$.
3. Determine the characteristic polynomial for $T$.

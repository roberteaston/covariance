Let $\phi: V\to W$ be a surjective linear transformation of finite-dimensional linear spaces. Show that there is a $U\subseteq V$ such that $V=(\ker(\phi))\oplus U$ and $\phi\mid_U:U\to W$ is an isomorphism. (Note that $V$ is not assumed to be an inner-product space; also note that $\ker(\phi)$ is sometimes referred to as the **null space** of $\phi$; finally, $\phi\mid_U$ denotes the restriction of $\phi$ to $U$.)

Let ${\bf R}^3$ denote the $3$-dimensional vector space, and let ${\bf v}=(a,b,c)$ be a fixed nonzero vector. The maps $C:{\bf R}^3\to {\bf R}^3$ and $D:{\bf R}^3\to {\bf R}$ defined by $C({\bf w})={\bf v}\times {\bf w}$ and $D({\bf w})=({\bf v}\cdot {\bf w}){\bf v}$ are linear transformations.
1. Determine the eigenvalues of $C$ and $D$.
2. Determine the eigenspaces of $C$ and $D$ as subspaces of ${\bf R}^3$, in terms of $a, b, c$.
3. Find a matrix for $C$ with respect to the standard basis. 

Show all work and explain reasoning.

Let $V$ be a vector space with basis ${\bf v}_0,\ldots, {\bf v}_n$ and let $a_0,\ldots, a_n$ be scalars. Define a linear transformation $T:V\to V$ by the rules $T({\bf v}_i)={\bf v}_{i+1}$ if $i<n$, and $T({\bf v}_n)=a_0{\bf v}_0+a_1{\bf v}_1+\cdots +a_n {\bf v}_n$. You don't have to prove this defines a linear transformation. Determine the matrix for $T$ with respect to the basis ${\bf v}_0,\ldots, {\bf v}_n$, and determine the characteristic polynomial of $T$.

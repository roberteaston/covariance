Let $L$ be the line $L$ parameterized by $L(t)=(2t,-3t,t)$ for $t\in {\bf R}$, and let $T:{\bf R}^3\to {\bf R}^3$ be the linear transformation that is orthogonal projection onto $L$.

1. Describe $\operatorname{ker}(T)$ and $\operatorname{im}(T)$, either implicitly (using equations in $x,y,z$) or parametrically.
2. List the eigenvalues of $T$ and their geometric multiplicities.
3. Find a basis for each eigenspace of $T$.
4. Let $A$ be the matrix for $T$ with respect to the standard basis. Find a diagonal matrix $B$ and an invertible matrix $S$ such that $B=S^{-1}AS$. (You do not have to compute $A$.)

Let $V$ denote the real vector space of polynomials in $x$ of degree at most 3. Let $\mathcal{B}=\{1, x, x^2, x^3\}$ be a basis for $V$ and $T:V\to V$ be the function defined by $T(f(x))=f(x)+f'(x)$.

1. Prove that $T$ is a linear transformation.
2. Find $[T]_{\mathcal{B}}$, the matrix representation for $T$ in terms of the basis $\mathcal{B}$.
3. Is $T$ diagonalizable? If yes, find a matrix $A$ so that $A[T]_{\mathcal{B}}A^{-1}$ is diagonal, otherwise explain why $T$ is not diagonalizable.

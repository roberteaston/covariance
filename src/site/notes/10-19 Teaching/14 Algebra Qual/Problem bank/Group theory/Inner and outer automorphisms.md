Let $C$ be a (possibly infinite) cyclic group, and let $\operatorname{Aut}(C)$ and $\operatorname{Inn}(C)$ be the groups of automorphisms and inner automorphisms, respectively. (Recall an automorphism $\gamma$ is **inner** if it is given by conjugation: $\gamma(b)=aba^{-1}$ for some $a\in C$.)
1. Describe $\operatorname{Aut}(C)$ and $\operatorname{Inn(C)}$ in familiar terms, as groups you would study in a first algebra course. Prove your result. (*Hint:* Where do generators go?)
2. Write $\operatorname{Aut}({\bf Z}_{12})$ down explicitly, giving its generic name and computing the order of every element. Show all work.

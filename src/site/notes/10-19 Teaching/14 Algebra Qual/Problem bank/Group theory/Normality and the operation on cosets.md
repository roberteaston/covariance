Let $G$ be a group and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. Let $aN$ denote the left coset defined by $a\in G$, and consider the binary operation

$$G/N\times G/N\to G/N$$

given by $(aN, bN)\mapsto abN$.

1. Show the operation is well defined.
2. Show the operation is well defined only if the subgroup $N$ is normal.

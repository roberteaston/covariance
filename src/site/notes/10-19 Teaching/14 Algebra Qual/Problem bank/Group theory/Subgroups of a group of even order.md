Let $G$ be a group of order $2n$ for some positive integer $n > 1$.
1. Prove there exists a subgroup $K$ of $G$ of order $2$.
2. Suppose $K$ in (a) is a *normal* subgroup. Prove that $K$ is contained in the center $\operatorname{Z}(G)$. (Recall $\operatorname{Z}(G)=\{a\in G\mid ab=ba\text{ for all }b\in G\}$.)

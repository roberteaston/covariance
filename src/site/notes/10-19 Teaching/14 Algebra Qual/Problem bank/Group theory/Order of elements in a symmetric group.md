Let $S_7$ denote the symmetric group.
1. Give an example of two non-conjugate elements of $S_7$ that have the same order.
2. If $g\in S_7$ has maximal order, what is the order of $g$?
3. Does the element $g$ that you found in part (2) lie in $A_7$? Fully justify your answer.
4. Determine whether the set $\{h\in S_7\mid |h|=|g|\}$ is a single conjugacy class in $S_7$, where $g$ is the element you found in part (2).

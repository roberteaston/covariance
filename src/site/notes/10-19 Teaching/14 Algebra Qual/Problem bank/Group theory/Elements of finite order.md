Let $G$ be an abelian group and $G_T$ be the set of elements of finite order in $G$.

1. Prove that $G_T$ is a subgroup of $G$.
2. Prove that every non-identity element of $G/G_T$ has infinite order.
3. Characterize the elements of $G_T$ when $G={\bf R}/{\bf Z}$, where ${\bf R}$ is the additive group of real numbers.

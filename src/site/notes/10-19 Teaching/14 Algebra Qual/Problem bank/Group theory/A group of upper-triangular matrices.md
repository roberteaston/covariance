Let $G$ be the group of upper-triangular real matrices $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d\end{bmatrix}$ with $a,d\neq 0$, under matrix multiplication. Let $S$ be the subset of $G$ defined by $d=1$. Show that $S$ is normal and that $G/S\cong {\bf R}^{\times}$, the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers.

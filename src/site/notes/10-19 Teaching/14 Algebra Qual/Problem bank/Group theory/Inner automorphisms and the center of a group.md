Let $G$ be a group. For each $a\in G$, let $\gamma_a$ denote the automorphism of $G$ defined by $\gamma_a(b)=aba^{-1}$ for all $b\in G$. The set $\operatorname{Inn}(G)=\{\gamma_a:a\in G\}$ is a subgroup of the automorphism group of $G$, called the subgroup of **inner** automorphisms.

Prove that $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ is isomorphic to $G/Z(G)$, where $Z(G)$ is the center of $G$.

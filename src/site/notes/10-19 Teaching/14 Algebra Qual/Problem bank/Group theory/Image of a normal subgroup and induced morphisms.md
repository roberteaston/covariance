Let $\sigma:G\to H$ be a group epimorphism. Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ and $K=\sigma(N)$, the image of $N$ in $H$.
1. Prove that $K$ is a normal subgroup of $H$. Give an example to show that this is not true if $\sigma$ is not onto.
2. Under what conditions does $\sigma$ induce a homomorphism $G/N\to H/K$, and when is this an isomorphism? Prove your answer.

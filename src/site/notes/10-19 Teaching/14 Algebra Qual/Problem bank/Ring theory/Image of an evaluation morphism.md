Let $k\subset K$ be fields, and let $k[X]$ be the polynomial ring in one variable with coefficients in $k$. The **evaluation at $z\in K$**  is a ring homomorphism $\varepsilon:k[X]\to K$ defined by $\varepsilon(f(X))=f(z)$. Prove that if $\varepsilon$ is not injective, then $\varepsilon(k[X])$ is a field.

The {\bfseries evaluation} at $z\in K$  is a ring homomorphism $\varepsilon:k[X]\to K$ defined by $\varepsilon(f(X))=f(z)$. Prove that if $\varepsilon$ is not injective, then $\varepsilon(k[X])$ is a field.

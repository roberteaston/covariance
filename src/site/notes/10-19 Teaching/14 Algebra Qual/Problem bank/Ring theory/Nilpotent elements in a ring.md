Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1. We say an element $n\in R$ is **nilpotent** if there exists a number $k\in {\bf N}$ such that $n^k=0$.

1. Show that if $n$ is nilpotent, then $1-n$ is a unit.
2. Give an example of a commutative ring with 1 that has no nonzero nilpotent elements, but is not an integral domain.

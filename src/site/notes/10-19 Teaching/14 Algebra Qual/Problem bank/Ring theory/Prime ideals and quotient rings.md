Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity, let $I\subseteq R$ be an ideal, and let $\pi:R\to R/I$ be the natural projection homomorphism.

1. Show that if $\wp$ is a prime ideal of $R/I$, then $\pi^{-1}(\wp)$ is a prime ideal of $R$.
2. Show that the assignment $\wp\mapsto\pi^{-1}(\wp)$ is injective on the set of prime ideals of $R/I$.

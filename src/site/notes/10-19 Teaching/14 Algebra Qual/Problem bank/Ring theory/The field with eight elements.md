Let ${\bf Z}_2=\{0,1\}$ be the field of two elements. The quotient ring ${\bf Z}_2[x]/\langle x^3+x+1\rangle$ is a field of cardinality 8, containing ${\bf Z}_2$. Let $\pi:{\bf Z}_2[x]\to {\bf Z}_2[x]/\langle x^3+x+1\rangle$ be the natural projection.
1. Write down a set of eight distinct coset representatives for the elements of this field.
2. Determine the multiplicative inverse of $\pi(x)$ in terms of your coset representatives.

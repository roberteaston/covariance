Let ${\bf Z}[X]$ be the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients, and let $K\subset {\bf Z}[X]$ be the kernel of the "evaluation at $1$" homomorphism

$$\begin{align*}\varepsilon_1:{\bf Z}[X] &\to {\bf Z}_3\\f(X) &\mapsto [f(1)]_3.\end{align*}$$

1. Characterize $K$ as a set.
2. Determine whether $K$ is a maximal ideal. Fully justify your conclusion.
3. Determine whether $K$ is a principal ideal. Justify by either exhibiting a generator or proving that there isn't one.

Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unit. We call $A$ **Boolean** if $a^2=a$ for every $a\in A$. Prove that in a Boolean ring $A$ each of the following holds:

1. $2a=0$ for every $a\in A$.
2. If $I$ is a prime ideal then $A/I$ is a field with two elements (and in particular $I$ is maximal).
3. If $I=(a,b)$ is the ideal generated by $a$ and $b$ then $I$ can be generated by the single element $a+b+ab$. Conclude that every finitely generated ideal is principal.

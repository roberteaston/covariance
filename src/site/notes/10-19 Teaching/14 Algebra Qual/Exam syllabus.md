You can find the official syllabus for the qualifying exam [here](https://math.calpoly.edu/course-exam-requirements). For quick reference, that information is also recreated below. This local version has the advantage that (eventually) terms will be linked directly to relevant notes within this wiki.

## Topics covered

The examination covers basic properties of fundamental algebraic structures. The following is a (not necessarily exhaustive) list of topics from which questions are drawn.

### Linear algebra

#### Vector spaces

subspaces, bases, dimension, direct sums
#### Linear transformations and matrices

invertibility, matrix representation of a linear transformation, determinants, similarity, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization

### Group theory

#### Groups

basic properties of groups, subgroups, Lagrange’s Theorem, direct products, normal subgroups, quotient groups, cyclic groups, permutation groups, simple groups (definition of; simplicity of $A_n$ for $n\geq 5$), Cayley’s Theorem, Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups
#### Homomorphisms

kernel, image, isomorphisms, isomorphism theorems, automorphisms

### Ring theory

#### Rings

basic properties of rings, subrings, ideals, quotient rings, ring homomorphisms, isomorphism theorems, direct sums
#### Integral domains and polynomial rings

PID’s, irreducible, prime, units, associates, UFD’s, Euclidean domains, division algorithm, criteria for irreduciblity
#### Fields

characteristic, construction via quotient rings, fields as vector spaces, polynomial ring over a field

Beginning with the September 2025 exam, all problems will be drawn from a public "problem bank." This bank contains two types of problems: **template problems** and **pool problems**.

## Template problems
---

**Template problems** are generally computational with easily adjustable specifics. These types of problems are especially prevalent in linear algebra. Examples include problems such as:
- analyzing a geometrically-given linear transformation for specific properties such as eigenvalues or diagonalizability; e.g., see [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Linear algebra/Projection onto a plane\|March 2025 (Problem 5)]] or [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Linear algebra/Orthogonal projection and scaling\|Spring 2019 (Problem 1)]]
- counting the number of morphisms between two specific groups; e.g., see [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Group theory/Finding all morphisms between two groups\|Spring 2017 (Problem 4)]] or [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Group theory/Counting morphisms between specified groups\|Fall 2015 (Problem 1)]]

Template problems are available below:

- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Master lists/Template problems in group theory\|Template problems in group theory]]
- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Master lists/Template problems in ring theory\|Template problems in ring theory]]


## Pool problems
---

**Pool problems** make up the rest of the problem bank and include all problems that are not easily adjustable. These problems, when chosen, will usually be asked as is.^[Allowing for minor changes to improve clarity, streamline the question, etc.]

Pool problems are available at the links below:

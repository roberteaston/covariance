## Most recent update
---

**May 8, 2025**
- Fixed a typo in [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Pool problems/Group theory/Automorphisms of a finite cyclic group\|Automorphisms of a finite cyclic group]]. Previously the definition of the map $\mu_m$ was typographically mangled.
- The problem [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Pool problems/Ring theory/Boolean algebras\|Boolean algebras]] was removed from the Problem Bank. It is tricky in a way that does not necessarily test understanding of core concepts in ring theory.

## Earlier updates
---
**April 29, 2025**
- Relaxed a condition in the problem [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Pool problems/Group theory/Image of the identity is the identity\|Image of the identity is the identity]]. The original version assumed $\phi$ was an isomorphism of groups, but the desired result only requires $\phi$ to be a (homo)morphism.

**April 22, 2025
- Added dates for all exams given since Spring 2022

**April 5, 2025**
- Updated [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Ring theory/Morphism from the Gaussian integers (2)\|this problem]] to remove an incorrect hint. (Previously, the second part of the problem claimed that the kernel of the morphism required two generators, contrary to the fact that ${\bf Z}[i]$ is a PID.)

**April 4, 2025**
- Added this changelog page
- Removed from the Problem Bank all problems referencing Jordan canonical form and/or general inner product spaces. Specifically, the following four problems below were removed from the pool
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Linear algebra/Jordan canonical form of a matrix\|Jordan canonical form of a matrix]]
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Linear algebra/Jordan canonical form of a matrix (2)\|Jordan canonical form of a matrix (2)]]
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Pool problems/Linear algebra/Numerical range of a linear transformation\|Numerical range of a linear transformation]]
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Pool problems/Linear algebra/Projections and adjoints\|Projections and adjoints]]


**March 31, 2025**
- Added [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Notation Key\|Notation Key]]
- Updated typography


**March 29, 2025**
Initial release, including:
- Exam overview at [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/The Algebra Qual\|The Algebra Qual]]
- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Syllabus\|Exam syllabus]]
- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank\|Problem bank]], consisting of all problems asked on exams between [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Previous exams/Algebra Qual 2014-03\|March 2014]] and [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Previous exams/Algebra Qual 2025-01\|January 2025]]
- Recreation of all exams between [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Previous exams/Algebra Qual 2014-03\|March 2014]] and [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Previous exams/Algebra Qual 2025-01\|January 2025]]

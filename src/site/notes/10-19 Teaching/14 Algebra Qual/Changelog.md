**April 5, 2025**
- Updated [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Ring theory/Morphism from the Gaussian integers (2)\|this problem]] to remove an incorrect hint. (Previously, the second part of the problem claimed that the kernel of the morphism required two generators, contrary to the fact that ${\bf Z}[i]$ is a PID.)

**April 4, 2025**
- Added this changelog page
- Removed from the Problem Bank all problems referencing Jordan canonical form and/or general inner product spaces. Specifically, the following four problems below were removed from the pool
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Linear algebra/Jordan canonical form of a matrix\|Jordan canonical form of a matrix]]
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Linear algebra/Jordan canonical form of a matrix (2)\|Jordan canonical form of a matrix (2)]]
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Pool problems/Linear algebra/Numerical range of a linear transformation\|Numerical range of a linear transformation]]
	- [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Pool problems/Linear algebra/Projections and adjoints\|Projections and adjoints]]

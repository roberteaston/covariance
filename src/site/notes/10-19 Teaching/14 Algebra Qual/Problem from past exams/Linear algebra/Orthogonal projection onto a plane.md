Let $T:{\bf R}^4\to {\bf R}^4$ be orthogonal projection to the $2$-dimensional plane $P$ spanned by the vectors ${\bf v}=(2,0,1,0)$ and ${\bf w}=(-1,0,2,0)$.
1. Find (with proof) all eigenvalues and eigenvectors, along with their geometric and algebraic multiplicities.
2. Find the matrix representing $T$ with respect to the standard basis. Is this matrix diagonalizable? Why or why not?

Let $V$ be a vector space and $T:V\to V$ be a linear transformation.

1. Prove that if $T$ is a projection (i.e., $T^2=T$), then $V$ can be decomposed into the internal direct sum $V=\operatorname{null}(T)\oplus \operatorname{range}(T)$.
2. Suppose $V$ is an inner product space and $T^*$ is the adjoint of $T$ with respect to the inner product. Show that $\operatorname{null}(T^*)$ is the orthogonal complement of $\operatorname{range}(T)$.
3. Suppose $V$ is an inner product space and $T$ is an orthogonal projection, i.e., a projection for which the null space and range are orthogonal. Show that $T$ is self adjoint.

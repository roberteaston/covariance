Let $M_4({\bf R})$ denote the 16-dimensional real vector space of $4\times 4$ matrices with real entries, in which the vectors are represented as matrices. Let $T:M_4({\bf R})\to M_4({\bf R})$ be the linear transformation defined by $T(A)=A-A^{\top}$.

1. Determine the dimension of $\operatorname{ker}(T)$.
2. Determine the dimension of $\operatorname{im}(T)$.

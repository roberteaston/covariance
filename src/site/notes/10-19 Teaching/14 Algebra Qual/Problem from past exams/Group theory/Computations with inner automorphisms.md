Let $G$ be a group, and let $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ denote the group of automorphisms of $G$. There is a homomorphism $\gamma:G\to \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ that takes $s\in G$ to the automorphism $\gamma_s$ defined by $\gamma_s(t)=sts^{-1}$.
1. Prove rigorously, possibly with induction, that is $\gamma_s(t)=t^b$, then $\gamma_{s^n}(t)=t^{b^n}$.
2. Suppose $s\in G$ has order 5, and $sts^{-1}=t^2$. Find the order of $t$. Justify your answer.

Let $i$ be the imaginary number, let ${\bf Z}[i]=\{a+bi\,\mid \, a,b\in {\bf Z}\}$, a principal ideal domain, and let ${\bf Z}_2$ be the finite ring of integers modulo 2.
1. Define a ring homomorphism from ${\bf Z}[i]\to {\bf Z}_2$. You must prove it is a ring homomorphism.
2. Find, with proof, a generator for the kernel of your ring homomorphism.

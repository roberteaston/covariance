Let $F$ be a field and $F[x]$ be the polynomial ring, which is a principal ideal domain. Let $R=\{f\in F[x]:f'\in (x)\}$, where $(x)\subset F[x]$ is the ideal generated by $x$, and $f'$ is the (formal) derivative of the polynomial $f$. It is a fact that $R$ is a subring of $F[x]$.

1. Prove that $x^2$ and $x^3$ are irreducible elements of $R$.
2. Let $(x^2,x^3)$ be the ideal in $R$ generated by $x^2$ and $x^3$. Prove this is a proper ideal of $R$.
3. Prove that $(x^2,x^3)$ is not a *principal* ideal of $R$.

An element $r$ of a ring $R$ is said to be **idempotent** if $r^2=r$. Suppose that $R$ is a commutative ring with unity containing an idempotent element $e$.

1. Prove that $1-e$ is also idempotent.
2. Prove that $eR$ and $(1-e)R$ are both ideals in $R$ and that
   
   $$R\cong eR\times (1-e)R.$$
   
3. Prove that if $R$ has a unique maximal ideal, then the only idempotent elements in $R$ are 0 and 1.

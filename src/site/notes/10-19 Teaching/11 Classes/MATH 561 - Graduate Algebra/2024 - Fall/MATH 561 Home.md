# Welcome to MATH 561

We're older now, so it's time things make sense. This wiki is an attempt move at least one step in that direction, by collecting together all of the information we'll be discovering on our journey this quarter through module theory and category theory. Everything should be treated as a work-in-progress, with notes changing and updating frequently.^[At the top of each page you should see a timestamp indicating the last time that page was updated.] Feel free to peruse at your leisure.

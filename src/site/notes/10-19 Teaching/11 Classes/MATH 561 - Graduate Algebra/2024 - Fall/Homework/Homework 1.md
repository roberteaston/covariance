### Problem 1


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Suppose $R$ is a ring, $M$ is a left $R$-module, and $r\in R$ is an element for which there exists a nonzero $m\in M$ such that $rm=0$. Prove $r$ does not have a left inverse.

### Problem 2


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




 Suppose $R$ is a ring, $I\subseteq R$ is a left ideal, and $M$ is a left $R$-module. Let $IM\subseteq M$ denote the subset of all finite $I$-linear combinations in $M$, i.e., $IM = \left\{\sum_{\text{finite}} i_k m_k\,\mid\, i_k\in I,\, m_k\in M\right\}.$ Prove $IM$ is a submodule of $M$.

### Problem 3


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Suppose $R$ is a ring and $M$ is a left $R$-module. An element $m\in M$ is called a **torsion element** if $rm=0$ for some nonzero $r\in R$. The set of torsion elements in $M$ is denoted $\operatorname{Tor}(M)$.
1. Prove that if $R$ is an integral domain then $\operatorname{Tor}(M)$ is a submodule of $M$.
2. Give an example of a ring $R$ and $R$-module $M$ such that $\operatorname{Tor}(M)$ is not a submodule. (*Hint:* Consider torsion elements in the $R$-module $R$ for some specific ring $R$.)
3. Suppose $R$ has a (nonzero) zero divisor and $M$ is nontrivial. Prove that $M$ has nonzero torsion elements.
4. Suppose $\phi:M\to N$ is an $R$-module morphism. Prove that $\phi(\operatorname{Tor}(M))\subseteq \operatorname{Tor}(N)$.

### Problem 4


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Suppose $R$ is a ring and $M$ is a left $R$-module.
1. For each submodule $N$ on $M$, the **annihilator** of $N$ in $R$ is defined to be the set of elements $r\in R$ such that $rn=0$ for all $n\in N$. Prove that the annihilator of $N$ in $R$ is a 2-sided ideal of $R$.
2. For each right ideal $I$ of $R$, the **annihilator** of $I$ in $M$ is defined to be the set of all elements $m\in M$ such that $im=0$ for all $i\in I$. Prove that the annihilator of $I$ in $M$ is a submodule of $M$.
3. Consider the ${\bf Z}$-module $M={\bf Z}_{24}\times {\bf Z}_{15}\times {\bf Z}_{50}$ and ideal $I=2{\bf Z}$. Determine the annihilator of $M$ in ${\bf Z}$ and the annihilator of $I$ in $M$.

### Problem 5


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Give an example of a ring $R$, two $R$-modules $M$ and $N$, and a set map $f:M\to N$ such that $f$ is a group morphism but not an $R$-module morphism.

</div></div>

### Problem 6


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring and $M$ is left $R$-module. Prove that $\operatorname{Hom}_R(R,M)$ and $M$ are isomorphic as left $R$-modules.

*Bonus challenge:* Is your isomorphism [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations#^cc0370\|natural]] in $M$?

Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring. Prove that $\operatorname{Hom}_R(R,R)$ and $R$ are isomorphic as rings.

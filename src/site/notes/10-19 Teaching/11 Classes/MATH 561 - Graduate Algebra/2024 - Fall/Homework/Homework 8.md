## Problem 1


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Consider the two matrices
$A=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -4 & 85 \\ 1 & 4 & -30 \\ 0 & 0 & 3\end{bmatrix},\quad B=\begin{bmatrix} 2 &  2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 3\end{bmatrix}.$
1. Show that $A$ and $B$ have the same characteristic polynomial, namely $c_A(x)=c_B(x)=(x-2)^2(x-3)$.
2. Show that $(A-2I)(A-3I)\neq 0$ and $(B-2I)(B-3I)\neq 0$, and conclude that $A$ and $B$ have the same minimal polynomial, namely $m_A(x)=m_B(x)=(x-2)^2(x-3)$.
3. Show that $A$ and $B$ have the same invariant factor(s) and hence same rational canonical form. Write down their shared rational canonical form matrix.

## Problem 2


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




1. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are non-scalar $2\times 2$ matrices over a field $F$; i.e., neither $A$ nor $B$ is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Prove that $A$ and $B$ are similar if and only if they have the same characteristic polynomial.
2. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are $3\times 3$ matrices over a field $F$. Prove that $A$ and $B$ are similar if and only if they have the same characteristic and same minimal polynomials.
3. Give an example of a pair of $4\times 4$ matrices $A$ and $B$ that have the same characteristic and minimal polynomials but are not similar.

## Problem 3


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Let $A$ be a $3\times 3$ matrix over the field ${\bf Q}$.
1. Show that $A^6 = I_3$ if and only if the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^6-1$ in ${\bf Q}[x]$.
2. The irreducible factorization of $x^6-1$ in ${\bf Q}[x]$ is
   $x^6-1 = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2-x+1)(x^2+x+1).$
   Show that if $A^6=I_3$ then there are at most nine possibilities for the minimal polynomial of $A$.
3. Continuing part (2), show that there are exactly eight possible lists of invariant factors for such a matrix $A$.
4. Use part (3) to write down all elements of order 1, 2, 3, and 6 in the group $\operatorname{GL}_3({\bf Q})$, up to similarity.

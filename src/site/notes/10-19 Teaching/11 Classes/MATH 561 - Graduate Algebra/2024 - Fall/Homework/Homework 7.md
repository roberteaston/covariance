Let $R$ be an integral domain and $M$ be a $R$-module.

1. Suppose that $M$ has rank $n$ and $S=\{m_1,\ldots, m_n\}$ is a maximal linearly independent set of elements in $M$. Let $N$ be the submodule generated by $S$. Prove that $N\simeq R^n$ and $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module.
2. Conversely, prove that if $M$ contains a submodule $N$ that is free of rank $n$ such that the quotient $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module, then $M$ has rank $n$.

>1. Show that for any $m\in M$ there is a nonzero $r\in R$ such that $rm=r_1m_1+\cdots +r_nm_n$ for some $r_i\in R$.
>2. Let $\{m_1,\ldots, m_{n+1}\}$ be a set of $n+1$ elements of  $M$. Find some nonzero $r_i\in R$ so that $r_i m_i$ can be written using a basis for $N$. Then show the $r_i m_i$ (and hence $m_i$) are linearly dependent.

</div></div>


> [!summary]- Solution
> 1. Let $A=\{x_1,\ldots, x_k\}$ be a fixed set with $n$ elements and define an $R$-module morphism $f:F(A)\to M$ by $x_i\mapsto m_i$. The image of $f$ is exactly the submodule $N$ and the kernel of $f$ is the set of all formal sums $r_1x_1+\cdots +r_kx_k$ such that $r_1m_1+\cdots r_km_k=0_M$. Since the set $\{m_1,\ldots, m_k\}$ is $R$-linearly independent, it follows that $\ker(f)=(0)$ and so by the First Isomorphism Theorem for modules $F(A)\simeq F(A)/\ker(f)\simeq \operatorname{im}(f)=N$. This proves $N\simeq F(A)\simeq R^k$.
>    
>    We next prove $M/N$ is torsion. Take any coset $m+N$ in $M/N$. The set $T=\{m_1,\ldots, m_k,m\}$ strictly contains the set $S$, the latter of which is a maximal $R$-linearly independent subset of $M$, so the set $T$ must be $R$-linearly dependent. This implies there are some $r_i\in R$ (not all zero) such that
>    
>    $r_1m_1+\cdots +r_km_k+r_{k+1}m=0_M.$
>    
>    We cannot have $r_{k+1}=0_R$, since the above relation would then yield a nontrivial relation on the set $S$. So we must have $r_{k+1}\neq 0_R$. But now notice that $-r_{k+1}m=r_1m_1+\cdots +r_km_k\in N$, so
>    
>    $-r_{k+1}(m+N)=-r_{k+1}m+N=N=0_{M/N}.$
>    
>    Thus, the element $m+N$ is torsion in $M/N$.
>    
> 2. First notice that since $M$ contains a submodule $N$ of rank $k$, the rank of $M$ must be at least $k$. (Any independent set of elements in $N$ is also an independent set of elements in $M$.) So we only need to prove $M$ does not have an independent subsets consisting of more than $k$ elements. To that end, suppose $\{m_1,\ldots, m_{k+1}\}$ is any set of $k+1$ elements of $M$. Since $M/N$ is torsion, for each $i$ the coset $m_i+N$ is torsion in $M/N$. This implies there is some nonzero $r_i\in R$ with $r_i(m_i+N)=0_{M/N}$; i.e., $r_im_i\in N$. But then we have a set $\{r_1m_1,\ldots, r_{k+1}m_{k+1}\}$ of $k+1$ elements in the module $N$ (which has rank $k$), so this set must be $R$-linearly dependent. This implies there are $r_1',\ldots, r_{k+1}'\in R$ (not all zero) such that
>    
>    $r_1'(r_1m_1)+\cdots +r_{k+1}'(r_{k+1}m_{k+1})=0_N.$
>    
>    Since $0_N=0_M$, the above equality gives the relation
>    
>    $(r_1'r_1)m_1+\cdots +(r_{k+1}'r_{k+1})m_{k+1}=0_M.$
>    
>    Every $r_i$ is nonzero and at least one $r_j'$ is nonzero, so (since $R$ is a domain) the elements $r_i'r_i$ are not all zero. Thus, the above relation implies the set $\{m_1,\ldots, m_{k+1}\}$ is $R$-linearly dependent. We've proven that $M$ does not contain any linearly independent sets with more than $k$ elements, and hence the rank of $M$ is no more than $k$. By our earlier remarks, this proves the rank of $M$ is exactly $k$.

> [!summary]- Solution
> First note that $I$ is contained in the integral domain $R$, so it is automatically torsion free. (If $ri=0$ for some $i\in I$ and nonzero $r\in R$, then the fact that $R$ is an integral domain implies $i=0$.) Also note that $I$ is nonzero, since the zero ideal is principal.
> 
> Next observe that for any pair of nonzero elements $a,b\in I$ one has $b\cdot a+(-a)\cdot b = 0$ and so the set $\{a,b\}$ is $R$-linearly dependent. This implies that the rank of $I$ must be less than 2. On the other hand, for any nonzero element $a\in A$ the set $\{a\}$ is $R$-linearly independent (since the only possible relations are of the form $ra=0$, which for nonzero $a$ yield only $r=0$). Thus, the rank of $I$ is exactly 1.
> 
> Finally, we claim $I$ is not free as an $R$-module. To see why, suppose to the contrary that $I$ were free as an $R$-module. We would then have an $R$-module isomorphism $I\simeq R^n$ for some $n\geq 1$. The rank of $R^n$ is $n$ (and rank is invariant under isomorphism), so we must then have $I\simeq R$. Such an $R$-module isomorphism corresponds to the choice of an element $a\in I$ that generates $I$ as an $R$-module. But this implies $I$ is a principal ideal, contrary to our assumption $I$ is non-principal.

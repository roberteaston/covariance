Let $R$ be an integral domain and $M$ be a $R$-module.

1. Suppose that $M$ has rank $n$ and $S=\{m_1,\ldots, m_n\}$ is a maximal linearly independent set of elements in $M$. Let $N$ be the submodule generated by $S$. Prove that $N\simeq R^n$ and $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module.
2. Conversely, prove that if $M$ contains a submodule $N$ that is free of rank $n$ such that the quotient $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module, then $M$ has rank $n$.

>[!summary]- Hints
>1. Show that for any $m\in M$ there is a nonzero $r\in R$ such that $rm=r_1m_1+\cdots +r_nm_n$ for some $r_i\in R$.
>2. Let $\{m_1,\ldots, m_{n+1}\}$ be a set of $n+1$ elements of  $M$. Find some nonzero $r_i\in R$ so that $r_i m_i$ can be written using a basis for $N$. Then show the $r_i m_i$ (and hence $m_i$) are linearly dependent.

## Problem 3


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Let $R$ be an integral domain, $M$ an $R$-module, and $N$ a submodule of $M$. Prove that the rank of $M$ is the sum of the ranks of $N$ and $M/N$.

(You may assume $M$ has finite rank.)

>[!summary]- Hints
> For part (2), let $\{m_1+N,\ldots , m_s+N\}$ be a maximal $R$-linearly independent set in $M/N$ and $\{n_1,\ldots, n_l\}$ be a maximal $R$-linearly independent set in $N$. Show that the set $\{m_1,\ldots, m_s, n_1,\ldots, n_l\}$ is an $R$-linearly independent set in $M$. Then use an [[10-19 Teaching/11 Classes/MATH 561 - Graduate Algebra/Exercises/Alternate characterization of rank\|alternate characterization of rank]].

## Problem 4


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Suppose $R$ is an integral domain and $M$ is a $R$-module.

1. Show that if $m$ is a nonzero torsion element in $M$, then the set $\{m\}$ is $R$-linearly dependent. Conclude that the rank of $\operatorname{Tor}(M)$ is 0.
2. Show that the rank of $M$ is the same as the rank of the quotient $M/\operatorname{Tor}(M)$.

## Problem 5


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Let $R$ be an integral domain and $I\subseteq R$ be a non-principal ideal. Prove that $I$ is torsion free of rank 1, but $I$ is not a free $R$-module.

>[!summary]- Hints
>To show that the rank of $I$ is no more than 1, observe that for any pair of nonzero elements $a,b\in I$ one has $b\cdot a+(-a)\cdot b = 0$ and so the set $\{a,b\}$ is $R$-linearly dependent.

## Problem 6


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Let $R$ be a PID and $M$ be a torsion $R$-module. Suppose $pm=0$ for some nonzero $m\in M$ and prime element $p\in R$. Prove that $\operatorname{Ann}(M)\subseteq \langle p\rangle$.

>[!summary]- Hints
>The ideal $\operatorname{Ann}(M)\subseteq R$ is principal. Also, since $p\in R$ is prime and $R$ is a PID, for every element $a\in R$ we either have that $p$ divides $a$ (i.e., $a\in \langle p\rangle$), or $a$ and $p$ are relatively prime (in which case we can write $ra+sp=1_R$ for some $r,s\in R$).

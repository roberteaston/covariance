Suppose $R$ is a ring and $M$ is a left $R$-module.
1. For each submodule $N$ on $M$, the **annihilator** of $N$ in $R$ is defined to be the set of elements $r\in R$ such that $rn=0$ for all $n\in N$. Prove that the annihilator of $N$ in $R$ is a 2-sided ideal of $R$.
2. For each right ideal $I$ of $R$, the **annihilator** of $I$ in $M$ is defined to be the set of all elements $m\in M$ such that $im=0$ for all $i\in I$. Prove that the annihilator of $I$ in $M$ is a submodule of $M$.
3. Consider the ${\bf Z}$-module $M={\bf Z}_{24}\times {\bf Z}_{15}\times {\bf Z}_{50}$ and ideal $I=2{\bf Z}$. Determine the annihilator of $M$ in ${\bf Z}$ and the annihilator of $I$ in $M$.

> [!summary]- Solution
> 1. We first verify the annihilator of $N$ in $R$ is an abelian subgroup. First [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Modules#^06c4a9\|recall]] that $0_R\cdot n = 0_M$ for every $n\in $N$. Take any $r_1, r_2$ in the annihilator of $N$ and observe that for all $n\in N$ we have $(r_1-r_2)n = r_1n-r_2n = 0_N-0_N = 0_N$, and so $r_1-r_2$ is in the annihilator of $N$. By the Subgroup Criterion, we've thus proven the annihilator is a subgroup of $R$ under addition. Now fix any element $r$ of the annihilator and let $s\in R$ be an arbitrary element. Then for every $n\in N$ observe that $(sr)n = s(rn) = s\cdot 0_M = 0_M$, where for the last equality we once again used the fact that [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Modules#^06c4a9\|zero acts trivially]]. This proves $sr$ is in the annihilator for every $s\in R$ and hence the annihilator is a left ideal of $R$. Similarly, we have $(rs)n=r(sn)=r\cdot 0_M = 0_M$, where for the second equality we used the fact that $N$ is a submodule so $sn\in N$ and hence it is annihilated by $r$. This proves $rs$ is in the annihilator for every $s\in R$, and hence the annihilator is a right ideal of $R$.
> 2. This will prove very similar to the argument above. First note once again that $i\cdot 0_M=0_M$ for every $i\in I$, and so $0_M$ is the annihilator of $I$ in $M$. Next suppose $m_1, m_2$ are in the annihilator of $I$ in $M$. Then for every $i\in I$ we have $i(m_1-m_2)=im_1-im_2 = 0_M-0_M=0_M$, and so $m_1-m_2$ is in the annihilator of $I$ in $M$. We've thus proven the annihilator of $I$ in $M$ is a subgroup of $M$. Finally, take any $r\in R$ and $m$ in the annihilator of $I$ in $M$. Then $i(rm)=(ir)m=i'm = 0_M$, since $i'\in I$ (as $I$ is a right ideal) and $m$ annihilates everything in $I$. Thus $rm$ is in the annihilator of $I$ in $M$, and hence that annihilator is a left $R$-submodule.
> 3. By the definition, the annihilator of $M$ in ${\bf Z}$ is the collection of all integers $n$ such that $nm=0$ for every $m\in M$. The module $M$ is a Cartesian product, which means that its operation is component-wise (addition) and that its zero element is the triple $(0,0,0)$. If we denote the general element in $M$ as $(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ then $n\cdot (m_1,m_2,m_3)=(nm_1,nm_2,nm_3)$, and so $n$ annihilates that element exactly when $nm_1=0$ in ${\bf Z}_{24}$, $nm_2=0$ in ${\bf Z}_{15}$, and $nm_3=0$ in ${\bf Z}_{50}$. In other words, the desired annihilator is $A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3$, where each $A_i$ is the annihilator in ${\bf Z}$ of the corresponding factor group $M_i$ of $M$. By our basic knowledge of the cyclic groups ${\bf Z}_k$, we know these annihilators are the ideals $A_1 = 24{\bf Z}$, $A_2 = 15{\bf Z}$, and $A_3 = 50{\bf Z}$. The intersection of those three ideals in ${\bf Z}$ is the ideal generated by their three generators, which (by definition!) is the least common multiple $\operatorname{lcm}(24,15, 50)= 600$. So in summary, the annihilator of $M$ in ${\bf Z}$ is the ideal $600{\bf Z}$.

>    Turning things around, the annihilator of the ideal $I=2{\bf Z}$ in the given module $M$ is the collection of all elements $(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ such that $(im_1,im_2,im_3)=(0,0,0)$ for every $i\in I$. Given the description of the ideal $I$, the annihilator are those triples such that for every integer $k$ we have $2km_1=0$ in ${\bf Z}_{24}$, $2km_2=0$ in ${\bf Z}_{15}$, and $2km_3=0$ in ${\bf Z}_{50}$. These conditions are satisfied exactly by $m_1\in 12{\bf Z}_{24}$, $m_2=0$ in ${\bf Z}_{15}$, and $m_3\in 25{\bf Z}_{50}$. The annihilator of $I$ in $M$ is therefore the submodule $(12{\bf Z}_{24})\times 0\times (25{\bf Z}_{50})$, which is isomorphic as an abelian group to ${\bf Z}_2\times {\bf Z}_2$.

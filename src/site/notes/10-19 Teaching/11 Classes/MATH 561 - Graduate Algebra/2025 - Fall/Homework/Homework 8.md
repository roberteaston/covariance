## Problem 1

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring. Prove that for each cyclic $R$-module $M$ we have $\mathcal{T}(M)\simeq\mathcal{S}(M)$; i.e., the tensor algebra is already commutative.

> [!info]- Hint
> Show the ideal $\mathcal{C}(M)$ is trivial.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring and $M$ is a free $R$-module of rank $n$, i.e., $M\simeq F(X)$ for some set $X$ with $n$ elements.  Prove that $\bigwedge^k (M)$ is a free $R$-module of rank $\binom{n}{k}$ for $k=0,1,2,\ldots, n$.

> [!info]- Hint
> You can use [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Exterior algebras#^51701e\|the fact]] that for $0\leq k\leq n$ the $R$-module $\bigwedge^k (M)$ is a free $R$-module with a basis explicitly given in terms of a basis for $M$.

## Problem 3

Suppose $F$ is a field of characteristic not 2. Show that for every $F$-vector space $V$ we have an $F$-vector space isomorphism
$V\otimes_F V\simeq \mathcal{S}^2(V)\oplus \bigwedge^2(V).$
In other words, show that every 2-tensor may be written uniquely as a sum of a symmetric and an alternating tensor.

> [!info]- Hint
> For each 2-tensor $z$, show that $z=\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{Sym}(z)+\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{Alt}(z)$, where $\operatorname{Sym}(z)$ and $\operatorname{Alt}(z)$ are the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric and alternating tensors#Symmetrization and skew-symmetrization\|symmetrization]] and [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric and alternating tensors#Symmetrization and skew-symmetrization\|skew-symmetrization]]of $z$, respectively.
>
> This will show $V\otimes_F F$ is the sum of the submodules of symmetric and alternating tensors. To show it is the direct sum, verify that the only 2-tensor that is both symmetric and alternating is $0$.
>
> Finally, you can use the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric and alternating tensors#^931c11\|fact]] that there is an isomorphism between the symmetric power (respectively, exterior power) and the submodule of symmetric tensors (respectively, alternating tensors).

Let $R$ be an integral domain and $M$ be a $R$-module.

1. Suppose that $M$ has rank $n$ and $S=\{m_1,\ldots, m_n\}$ is a maximal linearly independent set of elements in $M$. Let $N$ be the submodule generated by $S$. Prove that $N\simeq R^n$ and $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module.
2. Conversely, prove that if $M$ contains a submodule $N$ that is free of rank $n$ such that the quotient $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module, then $M$ has rank $n$.

Let $R$ be an integral domain, $M$ an $R$-module, and $N$ a submodule of $M$. Prove that the rank of $M$ is the sum of the ranks of $N$ and $M/N$.

Suppose $R$ is an integral domain and $M$ is a $R$-module.

Let $R$ be an integral domain and $I\subseteq R$ be a non-principal ideal. Prove that $I$ is torsion free of rank 1, but $I$ is not a free $R$-module.

> [!info]- Hint
> To show that the rank of $I$ is no more than 1, observe that for any pair of nonzero elements $a,b\in I$ one has $b\cdot a+(-a)\cdot b = 0$ and so the set $\{a,b\}$ is $R$-linearly dependent.

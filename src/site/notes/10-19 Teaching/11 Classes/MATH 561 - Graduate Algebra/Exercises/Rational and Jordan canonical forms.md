Let $A$ be the $4\times 4$ matrix

$$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & -2 & 0 & 1 \\ -2 & 0 & -1 & -2\end{bmatrix}.$$

1. Show that the invariant factors of $A$ are $a_1(x)=x-1$, $a_2(x)=(x-1)(x+1)^2$.
2. Determine the rational canonical form $R$ of $A$ and find a change-of-basis matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP=R$.
3. Determine the Jordan canonical form $J$ of $A$ and find a change-of-basis matrix $Q$ such that $Q^{-1}AQ = J$.

Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring and $M$ is left $R$-module. Prove that $\operatorname{Hom}_R(R,M)$ and $M$ are isomorphic as left $R$-modules.

*Bonus challenge:* Is your isomorphism [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations#^cc0370\|natural]] in $M$?

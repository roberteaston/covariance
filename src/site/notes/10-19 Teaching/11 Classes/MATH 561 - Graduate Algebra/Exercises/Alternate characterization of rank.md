Let $R$ be an integral domain and $M$ be a $R$-module.

1. Suppose that $M$ has rank $n$ and $S=\{m_1,\ldots, m_n\}$ is a maximal linearly independent set of elements in $M$. Let $N$ be the submodule generated by $S$. Prove that $N\simeq R^n$ and $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module.
2. Conversely, prove that if $M$ contains a submodule $N$ that is free of rank $n$ such that the quotient $M/N$ is a torsion $R$-module, then $M$ has rank $n$.

>1. Show that for any $m\in M$ there is a nonzero $r\in R$ such that $rm=r_1m_1+\cdots +r_nm_n$ for some $r_i\in R$.
>2. Let $\{m_1,\ldots, m_{n+1}\}$ be a set of $n+1$ elements of  $M$. Find some nonzero $r_i\in R$ so that $r_i m_i$ can be written using a basis for $N$. Then show the $r_i m_i$ (and hence $m_i$) are linearly dependent.

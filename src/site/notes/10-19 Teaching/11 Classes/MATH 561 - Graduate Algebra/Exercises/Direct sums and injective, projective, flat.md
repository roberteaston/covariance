Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with unity) and let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two $R$-modules. Prove that $M_1\oplus M_2$ is:
1. injective if and only if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are both injective
2. projective if and only if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are projective
3. flat if and only if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are flat

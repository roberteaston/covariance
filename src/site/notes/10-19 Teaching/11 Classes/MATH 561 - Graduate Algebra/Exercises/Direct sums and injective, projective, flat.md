Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with unity) and let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two $R$-modules. Prove that $M_1\oplus M_2$ is:
1. projective if and only if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are projective
2. injective if and only if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are both injective
3. flat if and only if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are flat

> - You'll likely want to exploit the isomorphism $M_1\oplus M_2\simeq M_1\times M_2$
> - Also recall that tensor product commutes with direct sum
> - You might also want to note that for a pair of morphisms $\phi:N_1\to P_1$ and $\psi:N_2\to P_2$, there is an isomorphism $\ker(\phi\oplus \psi)\simeq \ker(\phi)\oplus \ker(\psi)$

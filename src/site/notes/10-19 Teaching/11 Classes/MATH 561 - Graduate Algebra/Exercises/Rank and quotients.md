Let $R$ be an integral domain, $M$ an $R$-module, and $N$ a submodule of $M$. Prove that the rank of $M$ is the sum of the ranks of $N$ and $M/N$.

(You may assume $M$ has finite rank.)

> For part (2), let $\{m_1+N,\ldots , m_s+N\}$ be a maximal $R$-linearly independent set in $M/N$ and $\{n_1,\ldots, n_l\}$ be a maximal $R$-linearly independent set in $N$. Show that the set $\{m_1,\ldots, m_s, n_1,\ldots, n_l\}$ is an $R$-linearly independent set in $M$.

An object $i$ in a category $C$ is called **initial** if for every object $c\in C$ there exists a unique arrow $i\to c$; in other words, the hom-sets $\operatorname{Hom}_C(i,c)$ are all singleton sets.

Dually, an object $t$ is called **terminal** if for every object $c\in C$ there exists a unique arrow $c\to t$, i.e., the hom-sets $\operatorname{Hom}_C(c,t)$ are all singleton sets.

1. Show that an initial (respectively, terminal) object, if it exists, is unique up to unique [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Special morphisms#Bimorphisms and isomorphisms\|isomorphism]].
2. Show that in ${\bf Set}$, the empty set is initial and the singleton set is terminal.
3. Show that in ${\bf Ab}$, the trivial group $0$ is both initial and terminal. (Such an object is called a **null** or **zero** object.)
4. Show that ${\bf Field}$ contains neither an initial nor a terminal object.

An $R$-module $M$ is called **torsion**^[Check [[10-19 Teaching/11 Classes/MATH 561 - Graduate Algebra/Exercises/Torsion submodules\|here]] for a reminder of what it means for an element in a module to be torsion.] if $\operatorname{Tor}(M)=M$.
1. Prove that every finite abelian group is torsion as a ${\bf Z}$-module.
2. Give an example of an infinite abelian group that is torsion as a ${\bf Z}$-module.

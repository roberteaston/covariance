Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring. A nonzero $R$-module $M$ is called **irreducible** if it has no nonzero proper submodules.
1. Prove that an $R$-module $M$ is irreducible if and only if $M$ is isomorphic (as an $R$-module) to $R/I$ for some maximal ideal $I$ of $R$.
2. Prove that if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are irreducible $R$-modules, then every nonzero $R$-module morphisms from $M_1$ to $M_2$ is an isomorphism.
3. Prove that if $M$ is an irreducible $R$-module, then the endomorphism ring $\operatorname{End}_{R\text{-{\bf Mod}}}(M)$ is a division ring.

>1. Consider using some of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/The Isomorphism Theorems for Modules\|Isomorphism Theorems]] for modules. Also recall the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Submodules#Submodules and ideals\|correspondence between submodules and ideals]].

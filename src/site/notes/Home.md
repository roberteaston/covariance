# Welcome to Covariance

This mathematical garden is in its infancy, with a gardener who simply took a handful of assorted seeds and tossed them onto an empty field. Expect ideas to sprout sporadically. Entire crops will sometimes appear almost overnight. There will be pruning. There will be weeding. ~~There will be blood.~~

Please note that this garden is intended primarily for myself, as a place to gather, connect and organize information useful to me. I make no claims of originality. I often give no references or attributions. I include my own opinions and insights, both of which often change when I learn something new.

If you're reading this and you're not me, welcome.

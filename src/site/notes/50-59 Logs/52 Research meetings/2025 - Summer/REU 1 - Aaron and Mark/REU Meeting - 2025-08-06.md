This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2025-08-06.

## Meeting summary
---

Aaron walked us through the solution to Exercise 4 in VII.1, hitting on the main details of the monoidal structure in $B^C$ when $B$ is a monoidal category and $C$ is an arbitrary category. He also described the equivalence between the category $B^{C\times D}$ and $(B^C)^D$.

Mark then revealed a possible new reference for categorical representation theory. He's requested from our library a physical copy of this new reference.

We also briefly examined a monoidal structure on $\textbf{Set}^{\textbf{G}}$, at least in the case $\textbf{G}=\textbf{S}_3$. As we ran out of time, we noted that the "box product" of two permutation representations of $G$ was likely the representation on the Cartesian product of the sets (from the original two representations), where the group $G$ acts "component-wise."

## Tasks for next meeting
---

- Describe a monoidal structure on $\textbf{Set}^{\textbf{G}}$.
 - Write down what a means to have a monoid in $\textbf{Set}^{\textbf{G}}$. What does this mean in terms of representations?
 - Is there a monoidal structure on $\textbf{Matr}_F$? If so, write down what it means to have a monoid in that monoidal category and describe monoids in that monoidal category.

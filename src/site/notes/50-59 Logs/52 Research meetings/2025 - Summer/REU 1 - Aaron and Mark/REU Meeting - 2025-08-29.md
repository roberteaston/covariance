This following is a brief summary of our research meetings on 2025-08-29.

## Meeting summary
---

*Note:* Aaron was out sick for this meeting.

We discussed the definition of a *semisimple* category and how it is mainly just helpful language, but probably not so helpful for proving anything. For example, Maschke's Theorem can be rephrased as saying that the category ${\bf Vec}_F^{\bf G}$ is semisimple when the characteristic of the field $F$ doesn't divide the order of the group $G$. The fact that there are any conditions, however, pretty much kills any hope that a category of the form $C^{\bf G}$ is semisimple whenever the category $C$ is semisimple. Alas.

We then talked a bit about the final share-out of the summer and how to organize our project in the write-up. We noted that our investigations into monoidal categories probably qualifies as an aside, at least for now, as we move onto our next big goal: Kan extensions and induced representations!


## Tasks for next meeting
---

- Read Chapter X in Mac Lane, on Kan extensions. Focus mainly on Sections X.1, X.3, X.5 and X.7.
- Think about how to reframe induced representations and restrictions both as adjoints, and as an example of Kan extensions.
- Think about how the results on Kan extensions (especially when they exist and how to construct them) specifically in the case of induced reps. Can we give a categorical explanation for the construction of an induced representation?

This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2025-07-03.

## Meeting summary
---

Smooth sailing so far. Although everyone has hilariously chosen their own custom notation, there were no issues with categorifying a group $G$ and establishing isomorphisms between the category of $F$-linear representations of $G$, the category of $F[G]$-modules and the category $\textbf{Vec}_F^{\textbf{G}}$ of functors $\textbf{G}\to \textbf{Vec}_F$.

Aaron and Mark both cleanly (and simultaneously) outlined the natural transformations in $\textbf{Vec}_F^{\textbf{G}}$ and how they were equivalent to intertwiners of the corresponding $F$-linear representations (as well as module morphisms of the corresponding $F[G]$-modules).

We ended by sketching out the general battle plan for the next few meetings:
1. Summarize (with examples) the classical notions of irreducibility and indecomposability of representations, leading up to Maschke's Theorem and Schur's Lemma.
2. Port those classical notions into the category $\textbf{Vec}_F^{\textbf{G}}$.
3. Look for purely categorical methods to prove Maschke's Theorem and Schur's Lemma in $\textbf{Vec}_F^{\textbf{G}}$.

## Tasks for next meeting
---

-  classical definitions of
	- (ir)reducible representations
	- completely reducible representations
	- (in)decomposable representations
- Give explicit examples of each of the above , including possible combinations; e.g., a representation that is indecomposable and reducible.
- Give an example of a field extension $F\to E$ and a matrix representation over $F$ that is irreducible over $F$ but reducible over $E$ (see page 848 in Dummit & Foote).
	- Turn this into an example in the category of linear representations (as opposed to matrix representations).
- State Maschke's Theorem and summarize the proof
- Try the following exercises in Section 18.1 of Dummit & Foote:
	- 1, 2, 3, 5, 13-16, 20

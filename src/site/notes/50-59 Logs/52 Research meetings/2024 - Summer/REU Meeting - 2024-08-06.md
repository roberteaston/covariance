This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2024-08-06.

## Summary of discoveries

At this meeting we mostly chatted about big-picture ideas. We speculated about some possibilities and noted that a lot of ideas have been ruled out. Some things we're currently missing:
- A good method of quickly finding tropical equations that define a given congruence variety
- An algebraic method for determining when a tropical line (i.e., bend locus of a linear polynomial) is "tropically tangent" to a tropical conic (i.e., bend locus of a given quadratic polynomial).
- An understanding of the analysis in the classical case, in which tangency is detected via some minors of some matrices, ultimately leading to a formula for the dual conic.
At our next meeting I'll reveal some facts about congruence varieties that I haven't mentioned yet (which might help us with one of our issues above), and briefly outline the tangent/duality argument in the classical case.

# Tasks for next meeting

- Put our current investigations temporarily on hold and instead take a few days to prepare for the next "share out".
- Directions from Professor Champney for this "share out" are to ponder answers to the following questions:
	1. What is some work you've had to do that you were not expecting?Â 
	2. What went faster/slower than you anticipated?
	3. How is your team handling roadblocks or unexpected things that happen in your work?
	and then to give an 10-minute presentation on the project.

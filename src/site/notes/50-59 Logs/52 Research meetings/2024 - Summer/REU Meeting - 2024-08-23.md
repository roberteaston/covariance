This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2024-08-23.

Aaron outlined his findings on the intersections between quadratic congruence varieties and linear congruence varieties. I will add his discoveries (and much more!) to this wiki over the next week or so.

I then talked about some challenges tracking down results in tropical geometry (e.g., competing notions, incoherent papers, etc.), and talked about a promising notion of *rank*  for tropical matrices that might help us detect/understand intersections of tropical curves (at least bend loci, perhaps). Unfortunately, there are many competing notions of rank for tropical matrices (including a fancy new notion called the *ultimate rank*), so further investigation is needed. We will save that for future investigators, though.

Instead, we will start to wrap up our work this summer and focus on creating a poster summarizing our project, what we found, and what some possible next steps might be.

# Tasks for next meeting

- Put together a draft of a research poster for this project. It doesn't have to be perfect. We'll make edits and finalize things at our next meeting.

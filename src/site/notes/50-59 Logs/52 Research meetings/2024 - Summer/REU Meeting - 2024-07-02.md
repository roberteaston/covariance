This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2024-07-02.

## What happened

I gave a overview of our plan for the summer. See the [[Project Timeline (snapshot)\|Project Timeline (snapshot)]] for a quick summary. I then gave a brief (possibly incoherent) condensed preview of our ultimate goal: a duality for tropical projective plane conics.

Our first goal: learn the duality map for classical projective plane conics.

Step 1: Learn the foundations of algebraic geometry, focusing on:
	- affine varieties
	- the algebra-geometry correspondence
	- the projective plane
	- projective plane curves

This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2024-07-05.

## What happened

- Liam presented a solution to Exercise 1a in Section 1.2. By first completing the squares, he was able to rewrite the equation
  $x^2+4y^2+2x-16y+1=0$
  as the equation
  $\frac{1}{4^2}(x+1)^2+\frac{1}{2^2}(y-2)^2=1.$
  He then recognized this as an equation of an ellipse, centered at $(-1,2)$ with "horizontal radius" $4$ and "vertical radius" $2$:

- Nicholas presented a solution to Exercise 1b in Section 1.2, noting that the equation $x^2-y^2=0$ was equivalent to the conditions that either $x=y$ or $x=-y$. (This can be seen either by solving the equation for $y$, or by factoring as $(x-y)(x+y)=0$.) Thus, the solution set was the union of two lines:

- Aaron presented a solution of Exercise 4d, noting that the equation $xz^2-xy=0$ is equivalent to the conditions that either $x=0$ or $y=z^2$. Thus, the solution set was the union of the plane $x=0$ and the parabolic cylinder $y=z^2$:

  (Ignore the janky edges. Those are rendering errors in the Desmos 3D visualizer.)

- Aaron also sketched the solution to Exercise 8 in Section 1.2, following the solution strategy outlined in the book. The crux of the argument relied on the fact that a polynomial in one variable has at most a finite number of zeroes.

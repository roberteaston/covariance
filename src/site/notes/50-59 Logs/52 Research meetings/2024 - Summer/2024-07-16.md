This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2024-07-16.

## Summary of discoveries

- The entire team took turns working through [[20-29 Research/24 Summer REUs/2024/Examples of classical conic duality\|Examples of classical conic duality]]. Their solution has been put into that page now.

## Questions

- How does one prove the duality, or at least derive the formula for the dual curve? (We'll save the for the future.)

# Tasks for next meeting

- Read Sections 2.1 and 2.2 in [Kathryn Burton's paper](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rweaston_calpoly_edu/EQ4NAss4etlOmWnkXkyJIDcB8mNO4it9xyQstF5BDQM4Bg?e=ZK5S55)
- Take a look at page 96 in ["Tropical conics for the layman"](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjXgnHVvUalnkPRvKEHf_WpPoBFhqg?e=lfeJ6e), where there are images of 21 types of tropical conics
- Compare with Kathryn's list of 20 tropical conics and find the discrepancy
- Take a look at the following [Desmos page](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ywustbaxrr) page and try messing around with the sliders.
	- Can you figure out what is going on?
	- Can you produce examples of every (combinatorial) type of tropical conic?

This following is a brief summary of our research meeting on 2024-08-20.

We chatted about the problem of determining intersections of two congruence varieties, specifically the types of quadratic congruence varieties that "cover" a tropical conic with the types of linear congruence varieties that "cover" a tropical line.

When focused on a specific example. We first took a tropical conic of type $B_1$, specifically the bend locus of $f(x,y)=(0\odot x^{\odot 2})\oplus (1\odot x\odot y)\oplus (0\odot y^{\odot 2})\oplus (1\odot x)\oplus (3\odot y)\oplus 0$. We then looked specifically at the congruence variety "generated by the $y$ term", namely the congruence variety given by the tropical equation
$$x^{\odot 2}\oplus (1\odot x\odot y)\oplus y^{\odot 2}\oplus (1\odot x)\oplus 0=3\odot y.$$
This congruence looks like

Then we looked at a tropical line that did *not* intersect this congruence variety, namely the bend locus of $g(x,y)=(-5\odot x)\oplus (-4\odot y)\oplus 0$. We specifically looked at the linear congruence variety "generated by the $x$ term", namely the linear congruence variety given by the tropical equation
$$(-4\odot y)\oplus 0=-5\odot x.$$
The two congruence varieties look like

Finally, following the idea in the classical case, we solved the linear congruence for $x$ to obtain $x=(1\odot y)\oplus 5$, and then substituted that into the quadratic congruence variety (for the green curve) to get the equation
$$((1\odot y)\oplus 5)^{\odot 2}\oplus (1\odot ((1\odot y)\oplus 5)\odot y)\oplus y^{\odot 2}\oplus (1\odot ((1\odot y)\oplus 5))\oplus 0=3\odot y.$$
After some tropical algebra, this eventually simplified to the tropical equation
$$(2\odot y^{\odot 2})\oplus (6\odot y)\oplus 10=3\odot y.$$
Geometrically, we know this equation has no solutions. We can also confirm this manually by converting to real operations and considering cases. However, what we would really like is a simple algebraic method to detect that this equation has no solutions, analogous to how the discriminant can detect the number of solutions to a classical quadratic equation.


# Tasks for next meeting

- Try moving the linear congruence around and repeating the above analysis.
- Can you find that last quadratic equation for the general linear congruence of the form $s\odot x = (t\odot y)\oplus 0$?
- What conditions on $s$ and $t$ correlate (geometrically) with there being no solutions? two solutions?  a "segment" of solutions?
- Try switching up the type of linear congruence, e.g., use the linear congruence variety "generated by the $y$ term".
- Try switching up the type of quadratic congruence, e.g., use the quadratic congruence variety "generated by the $x$ term".
- Is there a tropical analogue of the discriminant, that can detect when a tropical equation has no solutions, etc.?

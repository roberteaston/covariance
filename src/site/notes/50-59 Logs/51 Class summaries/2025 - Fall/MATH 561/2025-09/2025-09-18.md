This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-09-18.

We spent the majority of our time discussing the themes of the class, especially **category theory**. Some highlights include:
- We're in the endgame now (at least for algebra and abstract thinking in general)
- Our main algebraic focus will be on a new algebraic structure, called a *module*. This structure will generalize the structures of abelian groups and vector spaces.
- We will be interweaving our algebra (module theory) with category theory
- Category theory will help us organize and clarify our thinking, lead us to new insights and unify diverse concepts across much of mathematics

We gave a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Categories#^a3b777\|definition]] for *category* and started talking about examples, but we'll have many more examples tomorrow (as well as formally define maps between categories, called [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors\|functors]]).

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-09-25.

We spent a good portion of the first half of class analyzing the hom-sets $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,N)$, i.e., the set of morphisms between two fixed $R$-modules. We noted (and mostly verified) that this set has a (natural) structure of an abelian group, and that when $R$ is commutative, even the structure of an $R$-module itself. And in the special case where $M=N$, the set $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,M)=\operatorname{End}_R(M)$ of endomorphisms of $M$ has the structure of a ring (and when $R$ is commutative, an $R$-[[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Algebras\|algebra]]). These observations hint at an idea known as "enriched category theory," which we sadly won't have time to explore.

We then moved on to talk about [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/Quotient modules\|quotient modules]]. Fortunately they match exactly with the usual construction of quotient groups in ${\bf Ab}$, just with an added $R$-action thrown in. We ended by talking about a "universal property" of the quotient module construction, an idea we'll explore much more deeply soon.

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-09-26.

We began by recapping [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/Quotient modules#^09ad61\|a universal property of the quotient module]] construction. I made the claim that this property uniquely characterizes the morphism $\pi:M\to M/N$ and that all properties of $M/N$ can be deduced from it. As an illustration, we saw how one can prove the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/The Isomorphism Theorems for Modules#^03b050\|Third Isomorphism Theorem for Modules]] with "for free" with repeated use of our universal property. (Once we have the corresponding universal properties for kernels and images we can give an even cleaner proof, without any references whatsoever to elements!)

We then explored the idea of a "universal property" for other constructions, looking at several [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal properties/Universal Properties I - Inspiring Examples\|other examples]], some familiar and others less so. We will return to this idea several times over the next few weeks, gradually filling in the details (including eventually a precise, formal definition for "universal property").

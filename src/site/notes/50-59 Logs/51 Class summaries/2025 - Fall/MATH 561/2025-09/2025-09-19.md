This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-09-19.

We introduced the notion of a map between categories, called a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#Definition\|functor]]. Each functor consists of two maps: an object map and an arrow map. These two maps must "respect the categorical structure," which basically means they commute with composition and send identity arrows to identity arrows. We then spent the rest of our time looking at a few examples, namely:
- The [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#The power set functor\|power set]] functor $\mathcal{P}:{\bf Set}\to {\bf Set}$
- Some [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#Forgetful functors\|forgetful]] functors, mainly from "concrete" categories like ${\bf Grp}$ to ${\bf Set}$
- The [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#Abelianization\|abelianization]] functor $\bullet^{\text{ab}}:{\bf Grp}\to {\bf Ab}$, which we will later see is an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Adjoints/Adjoints\|adjoint]] to the forgetful functor $U:{\bf Ab}\to {\bf Grp}$

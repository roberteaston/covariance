This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-09-23.

We first noted that, with our definition of module morphism, we can now talk about the *category* $R\text{-{\bf Mod}}$ of left $R$-modules. (We briefly outlined how our definitions of modules and module morphisms did indeed define a category.)

We briefly looked at some examples of module morphisms (especially the "zero morphism" uniquely defined between any pair of $R$-modules), defined the notion of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Submodules\|submodule]], and then explored a connection between module morphisms and submodules, namely the **kernel** and **image** of a module morphism. (Soon we'll see how every submodule can be viewed as a kernel of a module morphism, and as an image of another module morphism, so technically these two examples cover every possible submodule.)

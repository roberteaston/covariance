This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-09-22.

We introduced the notion of a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Modules\|module]], which is an algebraic structure that generalizes the structures of vector spaces and abelian groups. We looked at [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Modules#Examples\|some examples]], including how each ring $R$ can be given the structure of a left module over itself. We ended by introducing the notion of a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Module morphisms\|morphism between modules]]. We noted that there are only morphisms between modules "of the same type", i.e., between left $R$-modules or right $R$-modules.

Next class we'll look at a bunch of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Module morphisms#Examples\|examples of module morphisms]], as well as the related notion of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Submodules\|submodule]].

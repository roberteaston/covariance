This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-16.

Today we asked:

> [!question] Question
> What is special about the bimodule $M\otimes_S N$? What makes it feel like it "embodies the spirit" of multiplying elements in M with elements in N?

Running through a thought experiment, we ultimately decided that the search for a bimodule $P$ that would "embody the spirit" of multiplying elements in $M$ with elements in $N$ would amount to search through all of the sets of "bilinear, $S$-balanced, $(R,T)$-set maps" $M\times N\to P$ (where here we are suppressing the forgetful functors to $\textbf{Set}$). We then claimed that this collection of sets (one for each bimodule $P$) was the object function of a functor $F$ from the category of $(R,T)$-bimodules to the category of sets.

In this language, a "universal property" of our bimodule $M\otimes_S N$ is that it "represents" that functor; i.e., we have a natural isomorphism

$$\operatorname{Hom}_{(R,T)}(M\otimes_S N,-)\simeq F.$$

Although we didn't prove this natural isomorphism, we did give the idea for how it works. The full details are available [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Tensor products of modules/Tensor Products III - Balanced Maps and a Universal Property of the Tensor Product\|here]].

We ended by covering some [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Tensor products of modules/Tensor Products III - Balanced Maps and a Universal Property of the Tensor Product#Additional properties of the tensor product\|additional properties]] of our tensor product functor.

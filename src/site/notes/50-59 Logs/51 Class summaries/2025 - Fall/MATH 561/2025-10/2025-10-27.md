This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-27.

After recapping the situation of the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-):R\textbf{-Mod}\to \textbf{Ab}$ and projective modules, we repeated the analysis (skipping most proofs) for the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,N):(R\textbf{-Mod})^{\text{op}}\to \textbf{Ab}$.

We noted the following:
- The functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,N)$ is left exact. Modules $I$ for which this functor is exact are called **injective**.
- A non-obvious fact is that a module $I$ is injective if and only if it has the following property: whenever $I$ is a submodule of an $R$-module $M$, it is (isomorphic to) a direct summand of $M$.
- We noted (without proof) some examples of injective modules, and some examples of non-injective modules.

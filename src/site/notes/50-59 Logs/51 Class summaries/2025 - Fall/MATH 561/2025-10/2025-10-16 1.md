This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-17.

We finally directly addressed the motto "It's all about the arrows." In a given category $C$, we fixed an object $c$ and considered the functor $H_c = \operatorname{Hom}_C(c,-)$. Working through the details, we saw that this functor was the object function of a functor $H:C^{\text{op}}\to \textbf{Set}^C$. We then asked the reasonable question:

> [!question] Um ...
> What have we done?! Was this a good idea?

The first step towards the answer was [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal properties/Universal Properties III - Yoneda's Lemma#Yoneda's Lemma\|Yoneda's Lemma]], which characterizes the arrows from $H_c$ to other functors. We briefly sketched part of the proof, but ran out of time before hitting the key insight. Alas! We'll save that tidbit for next time.

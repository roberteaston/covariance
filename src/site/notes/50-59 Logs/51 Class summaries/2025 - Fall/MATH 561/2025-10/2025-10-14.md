This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-14.

We began by noting that there are many forgetful functors from categories of bimodules, such as the functors $(R,S)\text{-{\bf Bimod}}\to (R,{\bf Z})\text{-{\bf Bimod}}\simeq R\text{-{\bf Mod}}$ and $(R,S)\text{-{\bf Bimod}}\to ({\bf Z},S)\text{-{\bf Bimod}}\simeq \text{{\bf Mod}-}S$, and even all the way to $({\bf Z},{\bf Z})\text{-{\bf Bimod}}\simeq {\bf Ab}$. We then observed how we could use these forgetful functors to talk about morphisms between $(R,S)$-bimodules and $(R,S')$-bimodules, namely by first forgetting the right actions on each.

Suppressing the forgetful functor notation for simplicity, we then looked at the set $\operatorname{Hom}_{R\text{-{\bf Mod}}}(M,N)$. We then saw how this set has a "canonical" structure of an $(S,S')$-bimodule, where:
- the additive operation is "addition of outputs"
- the left $S$-action is via "right $S$-action on inputs"
- the right $S'$-action is via "right $S$'-action on outputs"

We then noted ominously how this unlocks a certain [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Bimodules/Bimodule morphisms#Triples of bimodules and hom-sets\|"triple hom-set" construction]], later to be seen as key for showing the general tensor product construction is a left adjoint functor.

We then briefly outlined a new, more general tensor product construction. Beginning with an $(R,S)$-bimodule $M$ and an $(S,T)$-bimodule $N$, we constructed an $(R,T)$-bimodule denoted $M\otimes_S N$, called the **tensor product of $M$ and $N$ over $S$**.

More next class!

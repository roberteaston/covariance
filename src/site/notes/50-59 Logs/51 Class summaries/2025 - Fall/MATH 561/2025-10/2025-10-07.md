This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-07.

We began by recapping the new notion of adjoint functors. We also [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Adjoints/Adjoints#What else do we know?\|noted]] that the natural bijection $\tau$ of the adjunction can be used to construct natural transformations $\eta:I_C\Rightarrow GF$ and $\varepsilon: FG\Rightarrow I_D$, called the **unit** and **counit** of the adjunction, respectively.

We then returned to the example of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Adjoints/Examples of adjoints#The abelianization functor\|abelianization functor]] as a left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U:{\bf Ab}\to {\bf Grp}$.

For a new example (which we'll generalize next class) we quickly reviewed the example of the free vector space construction, which provides a left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U:{\bf Vec}_k\to {\bf Set}$.

Finally, we started to see how the equalizer (and coequalizer) constructions can be reframed as provided right (resp., left) adjoints of a "constant" (or "diagonal") functor $\Delta: {\bf Set}\to {\bf Set}^J$, where $J$ is the category with exactly two objects and two distinct parallel arrows between them.

Next time we'll finally tackle [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/Free modules\|free module]] construction, as a functor left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U:R\text{-{\bf Mod}}\to {\bf Set}$.

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-28.

We recapped our investigation into projective and injective modules, said a bit more about injective modules, and then turned our attention to the tensor product.

We first noted that for each $(R,S)$-bimodule $M$ and every ring $T$, we have a functor $M\otimes_S -:(S,T)\text{-{\bf Bimod}}\to (R,T)\text{-{\bf Bimod}}$, which we could follow with a forgetful functor to ${\bf Ab}$ (if we wanted to have a functor most comparable to the two hom functors we previously investigated).

We then noted (without proof) that this tensor product functor is always **right exact**; i.e.,

Then for each short exact sequence of $(S,T)$-bimodules

$$0\to J\xrightarrow{f} K\xrightarrow{g} L\to 0,$$
 
the corresponding sequence of $(R,T)$-bimodules
 
 $$M\otimes_S J\xrightarrow{1_M\otimes f} M\otimes_S K\xrightarrow{1_M\otimes g} M\otimes_S L \to 0$$
is exact. (Showing the surjectivity of $1_M\otimes g$ was actually one of the midterm questions.)

We then said an $(R,S)$-bimodule was **flat (over $T$)** if the functor $M\otimes_S -$ was exact, which in light of the above property is equivalent to that functor preserving injectivity.

We ended by sketching a rough Venn diagram involving projective modules, injective modules and flat modules, with examples illustrating every possible option.

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-02.

We began by outline the notions of direct product and direct sum for an arbitrary family $\{M_s\}_{s\in S}$ of $R$-modules indexed by a set $S$. We noted that the direct product $\displaystyle\prod_{s\in S}M_s$ can be constructed as the set whose elements are functions $f$ from $S$ (to either the universal $\mathcal{U}$, or any set in the universe containing all of the elements of all of the modules in the family) satisfying the condition that $f(s)\in M_s$ for every $s\in S$. We briefly outlined the binary operation on that set of functions ("add outputs") as well as the $R$-action ("act on outputs"), as well as the "projection" maps $\displaystyle \pi_t:\prod_{s\in S}M_s\to M_t$ for each $t\in S$. We then sketched out how one can verify this module (together with those morphisms) satisfy the "expected universal property" of a product.

Following that, we briefly explained how the same module also has "injections" $\displaystyle i_t:M_t\to \prod_{s\in S}M_s$, but these *cannot* satisfy the analogous universal property of a direct sum (i.e., coproduct). The fix, however, was to restrict to the submodule of the direct product consisting of those functions $f$ for which $f(s)=0_{M_s}$ for all but finitely many $s$.

We then moved on to introducing the notion of a **natural transformation** between functors. We covered the definition and a few first examples, but we still have a lot more to see.

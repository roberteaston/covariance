This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-23.

After looking at some [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Exact sequences/Exact Sequences I - Illustrative Examples\|suggestive examples]], we defined the notion of an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Exact sequences/Exact Sequences II - Exact Sequences#^b7a639\|exact sequence]], at least in the category of $R$-modules. We then revisited our original examples and considered several more. Highlights included the following:
- a morphism $f:X\to Y$ is injective if and only if the sequence $0\to X\xrightarrow{f} Y$ is exact at $X$
- a morphism $f:X\to Y$ is surjective if and only if the sequence $X\xrightarrow{f}Y\to 0$ is exact at $Y$
- whenever we have a submodule $N\subseteq M$, we have an associated short exact sequence $0\to N\to M\to M/N\to 0$
- for any pair of $R$-modules $M_1, M_2$ we have a short exact sequence $0\to M_1\to M_1\oplus M_2\to M_2\to 0$
- for any morphism $f:X\to Y$ we have the associated short exact sequence $0\to \ker(f)\to X\to \operatorname{im}(f)\to 0$

We ended by introducing the more general idea of a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Exact sequences/Exact Sequences II - Exact Sequences#Chain complexes\|chain complex]]. As we'll soon see, functors between categories will be able to take chain complexes to chain complexes, whereas they will often take exact sequences to non-exact chain complexes. It's actually this "failure of exactness" that will make things interesting!

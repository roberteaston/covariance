This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-10-13.

We picked up where we left off last class, recalling the construction of the $S$-module $S\otimes_R M$ (for a fixed $R$-module $M$ and rings $R\subseteq S$). We then briefly outlined:
- The connection between $M$ and $S\otimes_R M$, namely the $R$-module morphism $\eta_M:M\to U(S\otimes_R M$) defined by $m\mapsto 1_S\otimes m$. (This is a component of the unit of the adjunction.)
- We didn't mention the explicits, but we do indeed have an actual functor $S\otimes_R -:R\textbf{-Mod}\to S\textbf{-Mod}$. For the arrow map, given $f:M_1\to M_2$ the corresponding $S$-module morphism $S\otimes_R f:S\otimes_R M_1\to S\otimes_R M_2$ is given on simple tensors by $s\otimes m_1\mapsto s\otimes f(m_1)$.
- We revisited some previous examples and noted some future results, such as the fact that for any finite abelian group $A$ we (unfortunately) have $\mathbf{Q}\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}} A\simeq 0$.

Rather than diving into the details, we noted that we will be better off in the long run first generalizing everything to [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Bimodules/Bimodules\|bimodules]]. So we spent the rest of the hour defining bimodules and the morphisms between them, and then outlining how this new notion generalizes all of our previous types of modules.

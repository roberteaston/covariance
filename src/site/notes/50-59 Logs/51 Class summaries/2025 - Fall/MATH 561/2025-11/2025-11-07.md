This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-11-07.

After recapping the general strategy, we spent the entire class working through the first half of the proof of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Linear independence, rank and the structure of free modules#The structure of free modules over a PID\|structure theorem for modules over a PID]]. Be sure to glance at the notes online for the full details.

Next class we'll complete the proof and see the important corollary, namely the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Modules over a PID - The Fundamental Theorem\|fundamental theorem for modules over a PID]].

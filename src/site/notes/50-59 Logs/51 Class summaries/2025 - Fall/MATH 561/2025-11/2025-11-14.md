This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-11-14.

We first recapped the general description of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Rational Canonical Form I - Definition\|rational canonical form]] of a linear endomorphism $T:V\to V$ of a finite-dimensional $F$-vector space, $V$. We then proceeded to outline an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Rational Canonical Form III - Computation#The Smith normal form\|algorithm]] to compute the invariant factors of $T$. The main work is to compute the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Rational Canonical Form III - Computation#The Smith normal form\|Smith normal form]], by starting with the matrix $xI_n-A$ and then proceeding to use basic row and column operations (over $F[x]$) to "diagonalize" this matrix into a matrix with a very specific shape.

We spent most of the class period working through an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Rational Canonical Form III - Computation#Example 1 Following the general algorithm\|explicit example]] of computing the Smith normal form (and hence invariant factors) for a given $3\times 3$ matrix, $A$. We noted how the invariant factors let us immediately write down the rational canonical form matrix, $R$, for $A$.

We then briefly mentioned how one can also obtain the change-of-basis matrix that will conjugate $A$ to $R$. [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Rational Canonical Form III - Computation#^de5ec5\|The process]] is a bit strange, but we will run through it in a few examples next class. And then we'll move on to the [[10-19 Teaching/14 Algebra Qual/Problem bank/Template problems/Linear algebra/Jordan canonical form of a matrix\|Jordan canonical form]]!

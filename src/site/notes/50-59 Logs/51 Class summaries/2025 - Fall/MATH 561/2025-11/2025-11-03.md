This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-11-03.

Inspired by the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Tensor algebras\|tensor algebra]] functor, we proceeded to ask for an analogous functor which produced *commutative* $R$-algebras. This led us to the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric algebras\|symmetric algebra]] functor. The construction was simple, namely quotienting the tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}(M)$ by the (graded) ideal $\mathcal{C}(M)$ generated by all tensors of the form $m\otimes m'-m'\otimes m$. This created commutative graded $R$-algebra $\mathcal{S}(M)$, called the **symmetric algebra**. We also introduced new notation, writing, for example, simply $m_1m_2$ for the coset $m_1\otimes m_2+\mathcal{C}(M)$.

We [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric algebras#Example\|noted]] how to think about this construction in the vector space example.

We also recalled a bit about the classical determinant function and started the construction of our final algebra, namely the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Exterior algebras\|exterior algebra]]. We briefly outlined the construction of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Exterior algebras\|exterior algebra]] and investigated some of its properties. We noted that in the exterior algebra $\bigwedge (M)$ we use the "wedge product" notation $z\wedge w$ for the product of two elements. The key feature of this new algebra is that $z\wedge z=0$ for every $z\in \bigwedge (M)$. We also saw that one consequence is that $m_1\wedge m_2 = -(m_2\wedge m_1)$ for $m_1, m_2\in M$.

Next time we'll recap the three constructions, as well as investigate the related notion of "symmetric" and "alternating" tensors.

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-11-10.

We began by finishing the proof of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Linear independence, rank and the structure of free modules\|structure theorem for free modules over a PID]]. That took most of the class period, but we did have time to note the immediate corollary, namely the structure theorem for  finitely-generated modules over a PID.

After first expressing the general module $M$ as a quotient of a free module and then using the structure theorem for free modules, we concluded that there is an integer $n\geq 0$, nonzero nonunit elements $a_1,\ldots, a_m\in R$ satisfying $a_1\mid a_2\mid \cdots \mid a_m$, and an $R$-module isomorphism

$$M\simeq R/\langle a_1\rangle \oplus \cdots \oplus R/\langle a_m\rangle \oplus R^n$$

The number $n$ was then defined to be the **free rank** of $M$, while the elements $a_1,\ldots, a_m\in R$ were defined to be the **invariant factors** of $M$. (They are unique up to multiplication by units).

Next class we will specialize to the case $R=F[x]$ with $F$ a field. In doing so, we'll obtain some famous fundamental results of linear algebra!

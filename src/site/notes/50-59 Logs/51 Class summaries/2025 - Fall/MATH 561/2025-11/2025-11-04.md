This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-11-04.

We began by briefly summarizing our three algebra constructions:
- The tensor algebra construction, $\mathcal{T}(M)$
- The symmetric algebra construction, $\mathcal{S}(M)$
- The exterior algebra construction, $\bigwedge (M)$

We then noted that each of these constructions produced a "special" type of $R$-algebra.
- The tensor algebra $\mathcal{T}(M)$ is a **graded $R$-algebra**
- The symmetric algebra $\mathcal{S}(M)$ is a **commutative graded $R$-algebra**
- The exterior algebra $\bigwedge (M)$ is a somewhat exotic type of algebra, sometimes called a **graded-commutative super algebra** (or something along those lines)

Each of our constructions is actually a functor to the appropriate category of "special" algebras, and is left adjoint to the forgetful functor back to $R\text{-{\bf Mod}}$.

In the case $R=k$ is a field and $M=V$ is a $k$-vector space of dimension $n$, we described bases for:
- The $k$-vector space $\mathcal{T}^i(V)$ of $i$-tensors
- The $k$-vector space $\mathcal{S}^i(V)$ of $i$-symmetric products
- The $k$-vector space $\bigwedge^i(V)$ of $i$-wedge products

We noted that $\bigwedge^n(V)\simeq k$  (with single basis vector given by $v_1\wedge v_2\wedge \cdots \wedge v_n$). We also noted that, if $T:V\to V$ is a $k$-linear transformation, then by functoriality we have an induced $k$-linear transformation

$$\bigwedge^n(T):\bigwedge^n(V)\to \bigwedge^n(V).$$

This transformation is entirely determined by the image of the single basis vector $v_1\wedge v_2\wedge \cdots \wedge v_n$, which must be sent to some $k$-multiple of itself. We denoted that constant by $D(T)$ and noted that this function, $D:T\to k$, satisfies the three properties that characterize the determinant function. Thus, $D(T)=\det(T)$.

We ran out of time to discuss [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric and alternating tensors\|symmetric and alternating tensors]], but that's okay. Next class we'll move on to studying modules over a PID.

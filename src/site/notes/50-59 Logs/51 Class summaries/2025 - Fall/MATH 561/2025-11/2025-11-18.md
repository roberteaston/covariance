This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-11-18.

Working with [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Jordan Canonical Form II - Computation#Examples\|two explicit examples]], we analyzed a second, optional canonical form of a matrix, called the **Jordan canonical form**. This form is *basically* the consequence of using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to further decompose the summands in the Invariant Factor Form decomposition.

Next class we'll fill in the details for how this works in general.

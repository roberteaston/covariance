This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2025-12-01.

Our last topic for the quarter is a survey of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Abelian categories\|abelian categories]]. We started by stating the six properties a given category might additionally satisfying. This broke down as follows:
- Two properties that qualified a category to be called a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Ab-categories\|preadditive category]] (or **$\textbf{Ab}$-category**)
- Two additional properties that qualified a preadditive category to be called an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Additive categories\|additive category]]
- Two last additional properties that qualified an additive category to be called an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Abelian categories\|abelian category]]

Some of these properties involved terms we hadn't defined yet, so then we started filling in those details. We defined
- [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Additive categories#Null objects\|null objects]]
- [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Ab-categories#Biproducts\|biproducts]]
- [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Abelian categories#Kernels and Cokernels\|kernels and cokernels]]

Next class we will pick back up with kernels and cokernels, and then proceed to:
- [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Chain complexes\|Chain complexes]]
- [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Abelian categories/Double complexes and mural maps\|Double complexes]]

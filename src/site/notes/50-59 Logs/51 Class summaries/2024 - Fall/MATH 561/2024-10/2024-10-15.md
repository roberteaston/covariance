This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-15.

We picked up where we left off last class, recalling the construction of the $S$-module $S\otimes_R M$ (for a fixed $R$-module $M$ and rings $R\subseteq S$). We then briefly outlined:
- The connection between $M$ and $S\otimes_R M$, namely the $R$-module morphism $j:M\to U(S\otimes_R M$) defined by $m\mapsto 1_S\otimes m$. (This should really be denoted $\eta_M$, since its the component of the unit of the adjunction.)
- How we have an actual functor $S\otimes_R -:R\textbf{-Mod}\to S\textbf{-Mod}$, by describing the arrow map. On simple tensors, given $f:M_1\to M_2$ the corresponding $S$-module morphism $S\otimes_R f:S\otimes_R M_1\to S\otimes_R M_2$ is given by $s\otimes m_1\mapsto s\otimes f(m_1)$.
- We proved a tiny [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Tensor products of modules/Tensor Products I - Extending scalars#A general property of this tensor construction\|lemma]] and then used it to show that for any finite abelian group $A$ we (unfortunately) have $\mathbf{Q}\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}} A\simeq 0$.
- We outlined the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Tensor products of modules/Tensor Products I - Extending scalars#Properties of our construction\|hom-set bijection]] through which the functors $(S\otimes_R - , U)$ are adjoints.
- We noted that since $S\otimes_R -$ is a left adjoint, it commutes with colimits, and hence in particular commutes with direct sums.
- We used that to quickly deduce that $S\otimes_R R^n \simeq S^n$.

We ended by asking the:

> [!question]
> Can we do something like this for two modules? In other words, if $M$ and $N$ are modules (maybe even of different types), can we modify our construction to produce a new module worthy of the notation $M\otimes N$? What properties would we want such a module to have?

We'll answer this next class, when we introduce the notion of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Bimodules/Bimodules\|bimodules]].

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-07.

We introduced the notion of a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations\|natural transformation]] between two functors. Intuitively, a natural transformation between two functors $F,G:C\to D$ is a map from the image of one functor to the image of the other. More precisely, it is the data of a family of arrows $\tau_c:F(c)\to G(c)$ in $D$, one for each object $c\in C$, that satisfies the expected [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations#Definition\|naturality condition]].

We took a peek at our first few examples of natural transformations, namely:
- the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations#The determinant\|determinant]]
- the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations#Free vector spaces and "insertion of generators"\|"insertion of generators"]] in the free vector space construction
- the idea/definition of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations#Maps between diagrams\|maps between diagrams]] of the same shape

We also defined [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Functor categories\|functor categories]]. For given categories $J$ and $C$, we let $C^J$ denote the category with:
- objects: all functors $F:J\to C$
- arrows: natural transformations between such functors

We also quickly looked at few small examples, noting that the functor category $C^{\textbf{0}}$ "looks like" the category $\textbf{1}$, while the functor category $C^{\textbf{1}}$ "looks like" the category $C$. (We will soon formalize the notion of "looks like" in the definition of an "equivalence of categories.")

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-24.

We spent the hour answering questions above various problems from the [[10-19 Teaching/11 Classes/MATH 561 - Graduate Algebra/2024 - Fall/Study Guides/Study Guide for Midterm Exam\|study guide]]. I noted that certain problems are too long to be asked as-is on the exam, but small parts of those problems could appear. Other than that, no new information was revealed (other than tips on how to approach some details of some of the problems).

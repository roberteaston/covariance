This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-22.

We took a deeper look at Yoneda's Lemma, including sketching out most of the details of the proof. The main takeaway is that each category $C$ can be embedded into the functor category $\textbf{Set}^C$, by sending each object $c\in C$ to the functor $H_c=\operatorname{Hom}_C(c,-)$.

This allows us to place any given category $C$ into a (much) larger category of functors. It also allowed us to finally formally define "universal properties." In particular, whenever we have a natural isomorphism $\tau:H_c\xRightarrow{\sim} F$ for some object $c\in C$ and functor $F\in \textbf{Set}^C$, we say:
- $\tau$ is a **universal property** of the object $c$
- the object $c$ (together with the natural isomorphism $\tau$) is a **representation** of the functor $F$ (and we call $F$ a **representable** functor)

We then proceeded to give a handful of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal Properties/Universal Properties III - Yoneda's Lemma#Examples\|examples]], but there are many, many more!

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-02.

We began by looking at a few more examples of functors, specifically the following two functors from $\mathbf{CRing}$ to $\textbf{Grp}$:
- the functor $\bullet^{\times}$, which on objects maps each commutative ring $R$ to the group $R^{\times}$ of units (i.e., multiplicatively invertible elements). We noted that the arrow map simply takes each ring morphism $f:R\to S$ to the group morphism $f^{\times}:R^{\times}\to S^{\times}$ that is identical on elements. (We mentioned that it's a fact every ring morphism takes invertible elements to invertible elements, so the map $f^{\times}$ does indeed make sense.)
- the functor $\operatorname{GL}_n$, which on objects maps each commutative ring $R$ to the group $\operatorname{GL}_n(R)$ of invertible $n\times n$ matrices.
These two functors will be connected (next week) via the determinant map, which is a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Natural transformations\|natural transformation]].

We then switched gears and introduced the idea of a "universal property." We will return to this idea several times over the next few weeks, gradually filling in the details. For now, we spent our time looking at a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal Properties/Examples of universal properties\|list of examples]], some familiar and some less so.

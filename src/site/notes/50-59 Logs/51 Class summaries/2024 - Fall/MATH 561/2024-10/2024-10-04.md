This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-04.

We spent our second day working our way towards a formal definition of "universal property." In particular, we:
- Formalized the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal Properties/Universal Properties II - Commutative diagrams, cones and limits#Formalizing the notion of "commutative diagram"\|definition of a commutative diagram]], using functors from "shape" categories
- Formalized the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal Properties/Universal Properties II - Commutative diagrams, cones and limits#Formalizing cones to diagrams\|definition of a cone to/from a commutative diagram]], by first defining the "diagonal functor" corresponding to a "constant diagram", and then introducing the notion of a natural transformation between functors
- Semi-formalized the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal Properties/Universal Properties II - Commutative diagrams, cones and limits#Limits (and colimits) are universal cones\|definition of limits (and colimits)]], as universal cones to (or from) a given diagram.

We'll return once more to universal properties, after we've officially seen natural transformations and Yoneda's lemma. When we do, we'll be able to clean up and make rigorous all of our ideas so far.

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on Halloween!

We investigated the exactness of the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-):R\textbf{-Mod}\to \textbf{Ab}$. We proved that for every short exact sequence in $R\textbf{-Mod}$

$$0\to J\xrightarrow{f} K\xrightarrow{g} L\to 0$$

we have an exact sequence of abelian groups

$$0\to \operatorname{Hom}_R(M,J)\xrightarrow{f\circ -} \operatorname{Hom}_R(M,K)\xrightarrow{g\circ -} \operatorname{Hom}_R(M,L).$$

Because of the above property, we say the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-)$ is *left exact*.

We then asked some [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Exact sequences/Exact Sequences IV - Exact Sequences and Functors#^f53166\|follow-up questions]], the first being whether there are $R$-modules $M$ for which the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(,M-)$ is exact, i.e., retains exactness on the right. We rephrased such a property [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Exact sequences/Exact Sequences IV - Exact Sequences and Functors#^4e244d\|in terms of diagrams]], with the short version being right exactness of this functor would be equivalent to "morphisms from $M$ pulling back along surjections." We called such modules *projective*.

We ended with an unproven (by us) [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Exact sequences/Exact Sequences IV - Exact Sequences and Functors#Facts about projective modules\|fact about projective modules]].

Next time we'll repeat this analysis with the hom-in functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,N)$ and a tensor product functor $M\otimes_R -$. For now, keep it spooky!

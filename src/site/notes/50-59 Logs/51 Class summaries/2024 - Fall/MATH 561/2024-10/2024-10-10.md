This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-11.

We began by recapping the definition of an [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Adjoints/Adjoints\|adjunction]] between two categories. We then spent the remainder of class considering the situation of a left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U:R\mathbf{-Mod}\to \mathbf{Set}$. First, we described the properties such an adjoint would need to have. We then carried out an analysis of what properties $F(X)$ would need to possess for some particular sets. We quickly deduced that we must have:
- $F(\emptyset)\simeq 0$, the zero module
- $F(\left\{\bullet\right\})\simeq R$, for any singleton set $\{\bullet\}$
- Using the fact that left adjoints commute with colimits (together with the facts that the colimit of a discrete collection of objects in $\mathbf{Set}$ is their disjoint union, while in $R\mathbf{-Mod}$ is their direct sum), we deduced that for any set $X$ we must have
  
  $$F(X)\simeq F\left(\bigsqcup_{x\in X}\{x\}\right)\simeq \bigoplus_{x\in X}F(\{x\})\simeq \bigoplus_{x\in X} R$$
This inspired us to realize that only possible definition of $F(X)$ must be $\bigoplus_{x\in X}R$, i.e., that the set of elements of $F(X)$ is the set of all finite, formal $R$-linear combinations of elements of $X$.

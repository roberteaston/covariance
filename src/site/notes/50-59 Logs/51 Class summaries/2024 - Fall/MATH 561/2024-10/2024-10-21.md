This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-10-21.

We finally directly addressed the motto "It's all about the arrows"^[Or, as I wrote on the board, "It's all abou' the arrows."] In a given category $C$, we fixed an object $c$ and considered the functor $H_c = \operatorname{Hom}_C(c,-)$. Working through the details, we saw that this functor was the object function of a functor $H:C^{\text{op}}\to \textbf{Set}^C$. We then asked the reasonable question:

> [!question] Um ...
> What have we done?! Was this a good idea?

The first step towards the answer was [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal Properties/Universal Properties III - Yoneda's Lemma#Yoneda's Lemma\|Yoneda's Lemma]], which characterizes the arrows from $H_c$ to other functors. We'll pick back up with this statement (and its proof) next time, when we'll also see lots of examples of this in action.

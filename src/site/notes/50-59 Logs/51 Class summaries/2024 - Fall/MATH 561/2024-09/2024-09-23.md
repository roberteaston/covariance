This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-09-23.
# MATH 561

Today we spent the majority of our time discussing the themes of the class, especially **category theory**. Some highlights include:
- We're in the endgame now (at least for algebra and abstract thinking in general)
- Our main algebraic focus will be on a new algebraic structure, called a *module*
- We will be interweaving our algebra (module theory) with category theory
- Category theory will help us organize and clarify our thinking, lead to new insights, and unify diverse concepts across all of mathematics (at least algebraic mathematics)

We gave a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Categories#^a3b777\|definition]] for *category* and started talking about examples, but we'll have many more examples tomorrow (as well as formally define [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Modules#^ac6884\|module]]).

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-09-27.

We first embodied the motto "It's all about the arrows" by studying the hom-sets between given $R$-modules, i.e., the set $\operatorname{Hom}(M,N)$. Although we didn't check every detail, we briefly outlined the following:
- The set $\operatorname{Hom}(M,N)$ can be given the structure of an abelian group, in which the sum of two morphisms is the morphism that sums the outputs of the two morphisms, i.e., $(f+g)(m)=f(m)+g(m)$. The abelian structure in $N$ (and the compatibility of module morphisms with that structure) guarantee this operation makes the hom-set into an abelian group.
- When the ring $R$ is commutative, we can upgrade this abelian group structure to a left $R$-module structure by letting $R$ act on morphisms by acting on their outputs, i.e., $(r\cdot f)(m) = r\cdot f(m)$. **I forgot to mention it in class, but in order for this to actually define an $R$-action on $\operatorname{Hom}(M,N)$, we need to require $R$ is commutative.** (Can you find which property of being an $R$-module requires $R$ to be commutative in this case?)
- In the special case that $M=N$, the abelian group $\operatorname{Hom}(M,N)$ can be given the structure of a ring; here, the second "multiplicative" operation is composition of morphisms. Although not mentioned in class, when $R$ is commutative this ring can be given the structure of an $R$-[[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Algebras\|algebra]], i.e., there is an $R$-action compatible with the ring structure.

We then quickly noted that familiar constructions from groups and rings port directly over into the category of modules. Specifically, we [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Module morphisms and submodules\|noted]] that kernels and images of module morphisms exist, are defined as expected, and are submodules of the appropriate modules. You can also defined [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/Quotient modules\|quotient modules]] (which, at the level of abelian groups, are exactly the same quotient groups) and there are the expected [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Constructions on modules/The Isomorphism Theorems for Modules\|Isomorphism Theorems]] for modules.

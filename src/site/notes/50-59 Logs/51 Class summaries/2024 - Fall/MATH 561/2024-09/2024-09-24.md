This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-09-24.
# MATH 561

Today in class we looked at a bunch of [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic Structures/Examples of categories\|examples of categories]] and then introduced the notion of a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Modules#^ac6884\|module]]. Specifically, we defined a *left $R$-module* for a fixed ring $R$. We also looked at our first few [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Basic definitions and examples/Examples of modules\|examples of modules]], including abelian groups and vector spaces. We'll see more cool examples next class!

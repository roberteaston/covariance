This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-09-30.

We introduced the notion of a map between categories, called a [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#Definition\|functor]]. Each functor consists of two functions, one map for the objects and one map for the arrows. These two functions must "respect the categorical structure", which basically means they commute with composition and send identity arrows to identity arrows. We then spent the majority of our time looking at a few examples, namely:
- The [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#The power set functor\|power set]] functor
- Some [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#Forgetful functors\|forgetful]] functors
- The [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Basic structures/Functors#Abelianization\|abelianization]] functor

In our next class we will look at more examples!

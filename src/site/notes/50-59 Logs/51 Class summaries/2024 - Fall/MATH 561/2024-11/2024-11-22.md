This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-22.

We once again started with a finite-dimensional $F$-vector space, $V$, and an $F$-linear endomorphism $T:V\to V$. As usual, this allowed us to put an $F[x]$-module structure on $V$ and then use our structure theorem to find an $F[x]$-module isomorphism of the form

$$V\simeq F[x]/\langle a_1(x)\rangle \oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/\langle a_m(x)\rangle,$$
where the $a_i(x)$ were the **invariant factors** of $T$.

We then introduced a new assumption, namely that the field, $F$, contains all of the roots of the invariant factors (equivalently, all of the roots of the minimal polynomial, $a_m(x)$). This assumption allows us to factor every invariant factor, $a(x)$, into powers of linear polynomials:

$$a(x)=(x-\lambda_1)^{\alpha_1}\cdots (x-\lambda_k)^{\alpha_k}.$$

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we then had a decomposition of the summand

$$F[x]/\langle a(x)\rangle \simeq F[x]/\langle (x-\lambda_1)^{\alpha_1}\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/(x-\lambda_k)^{\alpha_k}.$$

We then focused on each summand. Using the $F$-basis $\{(\overline{x}-\lambda \cdot \overline{1})^{k-1},\ldots, \overline{x}-\lambda\cdot \overline{1},\overline{1}\}$, we noted that the action of $x$ on that summand would be represented by the matrix

$$\begin{bmatrix}\lambda & 1 & & & \\ & \lambda & \ddots & & \\ & & \ddots & 1 & \\ & & & \lambda & 1 \\ & & & & \lambda \end{bmatrix}$$

We called this matrix the **Jordan block** corresponding to that summand. Repeating this for every summand eventually resulted in the **Jordan canonical form** for the matrix $A$.

We ran out of time before describing exactly how to compute the change-of-basis matrix, $Q$, for which $J=Q^{-1}AQ$. See [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Jordan Canonical Form II - Computation\|our notes]] for those details.

> [!warning] Minor homework update
> Since we did not get to the change-of-basis computation for Jordan canonical form, there has been a minor change to [[10-19 Teaching/11 Classes/MATH 561 - Graduate Algebra/2024 - Fall/Homework/Homework 8\|Homework 8]]. The one problem that required computing such a matrix has been made optional.

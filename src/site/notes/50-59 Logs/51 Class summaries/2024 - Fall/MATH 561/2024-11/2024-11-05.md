This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-05.

After recapping our new algebraic structure, called an ... (ahem) ... [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Algebras\|algebra]], we went on to construct a functor $\mathcal{T}:R\textbf{-Mod}\to R\textbf{-Alg}$ left adjoint to the forgetful functor $U:R\textbf{-Alg}\to R\textbf{-Mod}$. This functor is called the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Tensor algebras\|tensor algebra]] functor. To each $R$-module, $M$, it associates an $R$-algebra, $\mathcal{T}(M)$, defined by

$$\mathcal{T}(M)=R\oplus M\oplus (M\otimes_R M)\oplus (M\otimes_R M\otimes_R M)\oplus \cdots$$

On simple tensors, the product is given by concatenation of tensors":

$$(m_1\otimes \cdots \otimes m_k)\cdot (m_1'\otimes \cdots \otimes m_l') := m_1\otimes \cdots \otimes m_k\otimes m_1'\otimes \cdots m_l'.$$

The one "exception" to this definition is for the 0-tensors, which are the elements in $R$ in the first summand of $\mathcal{T}(M)$. For products involving elements from $R$, the multiplication is just the $R$-action on $k$-tensors.

Although we did not verify that this construction is actually left adjoint to the forgetful functor (for time reasons), we did look at a few [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Tensor algebras#Examples\|explicit examples]].

Next time we will talk about the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric algebras\|symmetric algebra]] and [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Exterior algebras\|exterior algebra]] functors.

This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-15.

We began by recapping the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Linear independence, rank and the structure of free modules\|structure theorem for free modules over a PID]]. We then proceeded to consider the more general case of a finitely-generated (but possibly not free) module over a PID. After first expressing such a module as a quotient of a free module and then using the structure theorem for free modules, we were ultimately able to deduce that there is an integer $n\geq 0$ and nonzero nonunit elements $a_1,\ldots, a_m\in R$ satisfying $a_1\mid a_2\mid \cdots \mid a_m$ such that there is an isomorphism

$$M\simeq R^n\oplus R/\langle a_1\rangle \oplus \cdots \oplus R/\langle a_m\rangle$$

We mentioned (but didn't prove) that this decomposition is unique "up to units." The number $n$ was then defined to be the **free rank** of $M$, while the elements $a_1,\ldots, a_m\in R$ were defined to be the **invariant factors** of $M$. (They are unique up to multiplication by units).

We then briefly explained the special case in which $R=\textbf{Z}$, in which we recover the Fundamental Theorem for Finitely-Generated Abelian Groups.

We also discussed the idea of factoring each $a_i$ into a product of prime powers, obtaining the so-called **elementary divisor decomposition** of $M$.

Next week we specialize to the case $R=F[x]$ with $F$ a field. We'll obtain some famous fundamental results of linear algebra!

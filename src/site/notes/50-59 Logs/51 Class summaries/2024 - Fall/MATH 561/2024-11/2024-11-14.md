This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-14.

We briefly recapped the notions of **Noetherian** and **rank**. We noted that a ring $R$ (when viewed as an $R$-module) is Noetherian exactly when all of its ideals are finitely generated; in particular, every PID is Noetherian. We also noted that for a free module $M\simeq F(\{x_1, \ldots, x_k\})$, the corresponding generating set $\{m_1, \ldots, m_k\}$ is linearly independent (and hence is worthy of the name "basis").

We then spent the rest of the class working through the main steps in the proof of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Linear independence, rank and the structure of free modules#The structure of free modules over a PID\|structure theorem for modules over a PID]]. Be sure to glance at the notes for a full proof that covers every detail.

Next class we'll look at the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Modules over a PID - The Fundamental Theorem\|fundamental theorem for modules over a PID]].

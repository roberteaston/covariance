This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-18.

Beginning with:
- a field, $F$
- a finite-dimensional $F$-vector space, $V$
- an $F$-linear endomorphism, $T:V\to V$
we put an $F[x]$-module structure on $V$ by letting $x$ act via $T$. We then noted that, as an $F[x]$-module, $V$ is still finitely generated. Since the ring $F[x]$ is a PID, our [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Modules over a PID - The Fundamental Theorem\|fundamental theorem]] guarantees an $F[x]$-module isomorphism of the form

$$V\simeq (F[x])^n\oplus F[x]/\langle a_1(x)\rangle\oplus \cdots \oplus F[x]/\langle a_m(x)\rangle$$

for some nonzero nonunits $a_1(x),\ldots, a_m(x)\in F[x]$ with $a_1(x)\mid a_2(x)\mid \cdots \mid a_m(x)$ in $F[x]$. We noted that the free rank, $n$, had to be 0 (since $V$ is finite-dimensional as an $F$-vector space), and also noted that we can make the invariant factors $a_i(x)$ unique by insisting they are monic, i.e., each is of the form $a(x) = b_0+b_1x+\cdots +b_{k-1}x^{k-1}+x^k$.

We then proceeded to analyze the direct sum decomposition on the right. See our [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Rational Canonical Form I - Definition\|notes]] for full details, but in short we noted that:
- the last invariant factor, $a_m(x)$, is the **minimal polynomial** of $T$
- the product of the invariant factors is the **characteristic polynomial** of $T$
- for each summand $F[x]/\langle a(x)\rangle$, the set $\{\overline{1}, \overline{x},\ldots ,\overline{x}^{k-1}\}$ is an $F$-vector space basis and with respect to this basis the matrix for $T$ (which acts as multiplication by $x$) is
  
  $$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & -b_0 \\ 1 & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & -b_1 \\ 0 & 1 & \cdots & \cdots & -b_2 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \cdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & - b_{k-1} \end{bmatrix}$$

This ultimately led to the **rational canonical form** for the linear transformation $T$.

We gave [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Rational Canonical Form I - Definition#Example\|one example]] of how this all looks for a $6$-dimensional $\textbf{Q}$-vector space with given invariant factors.

Next class we will see how to compute the invariant factors (and rational canonical form) of a given linear transformation.

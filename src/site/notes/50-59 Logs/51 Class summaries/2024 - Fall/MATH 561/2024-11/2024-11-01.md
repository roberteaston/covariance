This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-01.

After recapping the situation of the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-):R\textbf{-Mod}\to \textbf{Ab}$ and projective modules, we repeated the analysis (skipping any proofs) for the functors $\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,N):(R\textbf{-Mod})^{\text{op}}\to \textbf{Ab}$ and $M\otimes_R -:R\textbf{-Mod}\to \textbf{Ab}$, the latter under the assumption $R$ is commutative (so that we could use the Rapha construction to put $(R,R)$-bimodule structures on $R$-modules, as needed).

We noted the following:
- The functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,N)$ is left exact. Modules $I$ for which this functor is exact are called **injective**.
- A module $I$ is injective if and only if it has the following property: whenever $I$ is a submodule of an $R$-module $M$, it is (isomorphic to) a direct summand of $M$
- The functor $M\otimes_R -$ is right exact. Modules $M$ for which this functor is exact are called **flat**.
- Projective $R$-modules are flat.

This ends our initial survey into how functors can interact with exact sequences. There is a ton more to the story, but we'll leave it for now.

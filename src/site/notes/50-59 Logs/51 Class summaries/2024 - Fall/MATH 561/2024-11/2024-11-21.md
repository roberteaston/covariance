This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-21.

We spent nearly the entire class period working through the matrix in [[10-19 Teaching/11 Classes/MATH 561 - Graduate Algebra/Exercises/Rational and Jordan canonical forms\|this exercise]], namely the matrix

$$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & -2 & 0 & 1 \\ -2 & 0 & -1 & -2\end{bmatrix}.$$

We briefly talked about how the standard basis for $V=\textbf{Q}^4$ corresponds to a surjective $\textbf{Q}[x]$-module morphism $\pi:F_{\textbf{Q}[x]}(\{z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4\})\to V$, where the first module is the free $\textbf{Q}[x]$-module on four generators. This surjection establishes the $\textbf{Q}[x]$-module isomorphism

$$V\simeq F_{\textbf{Q}[x]}(\{z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4\})/\ker(\pi).$$

Our main structure theorem for free $\textbf{Q}[x]$-modules then tells us we should be able to find a new set of generators $\{z_1',z_2',z_3',z_4'\}$ for that free module, together with $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\in \textbf{Q}[x]$ such that $\{a_1z_1', \ldots, a_4 z_4'\}$ generate $\ker(\pi)$. How do we find those generators?

First we find generators for $\ker(\pi)$ and express those generators in terms of the original generators $\{z_1,\ldots, z_4\}$ for the free module. We can encode this information in a **relations matrix**. We noted that there are several very easy elements one can see in $\ker(\pi)$. For example, from the matrix $A$ we know that

$$T(\textbf{e}_1) = \textbf{e}_1-2\textbf{e}_3-2\textbf{e}_4,$$

where $T:V\to V$ is the linear transformation given by $A$ with respect to the standard basis. Since the action of $x$ on $V$ is given by $T$, another way to express the above equation is

$$x\cdot \textbf{e}_1 = \textbf{e}_1-2\textbf{e}_3-2\textbf{e}_4,$$

or equivalently,

$$(x-1)\cdot \textbf{e}_1 +2\textbf{e}_3+2\textbf{e}_4 = \textbf{0}.$$

By the construction of $\pi$, this means that the element

$$y_1 = (x-1)z_1+2z_3+2z_4$$

is in the kernel of $\pi$. By the same reasoning, the following additional three elements are in the kernel of $\pi$:

$$\begin{align*}y_2 &= (x-1)z_2+2z_3\\ y_3 &= xz_3+z_4 \\ y_4 &= -z_3+(x+2)z_4. \end{align*}$$

One can prove that the set $\{y_1, \ldots, y_4\}$ generates $\ker(\pi)$. By construction, the relations matrix for these four generators is the matrix

$$\begin{bmatrix} x-1 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\ 0 & x-1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & x & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & x+2\end{bmatrix} = xI_4-A^{\top}$$

Note that this is exactly the transpose of the matrix $xI_4-A$, which for unfortunate historical reasons is the matrix everyone uses to compute the Smith normal form. This means that row (resp., column) operations on $xI_4-A$ correspond to column (resp., row) operations on the relations matrix above. BOO.

In any case, we then detailed how modifying our generators for $\ker(\pi)$ correspond to row operations on the relations matrix, while modifying our generators for the free module correspond to column operations (but with a little twist) for the matrix above.

We then listed the row and column operations that transformed $xI_4-A$ into the matrix

$$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & x-1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & (x-1)(x+1)^2\end{bmatrix}.$$

This corresponding to a new choice of generators $\{z_1',z_2',z_3',z_4'\}$ for the free module such that $\{z_1', z_2', (x-1)z_3', (x-1)(x+1)^2z_4'\}$ is a set of generators for $\ker(\pi)$. This allows us to conclude that 

$$V\simeq F_{\textbf{Q}[x]}(\{z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4\})/\ker(\pi)\simeq \textbf{Q}[x]/\langle x-1\rangle\oplus \textbf{Q}[x]/\langle (x-1)(x+1)^2\rangle.$$

This allowed us to conclude that the invariant factors of $A$ are $a_1(x)=x-1$ and $a_2(x)=(x-1)(x+1)^2 = x^3+x^2-x-1$. 

We then discussed how to write down the rational canonical form, $R$, of $A$, as well as how to compute the change-of-basis matrix, $P$, such that $R=P^{-1}AP$. That latter step involved first tracking the changes to the generators of the free module to produce an "auxiliary matrix"

$$P'=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$

The third and four columns in that matrix told us $\textbf{Q}[x]$-module generators for two invariant summands in $V$, from which we were able to determine the corresponding $\textbf{Q}$-basis (by acting on those generators by $x$).

We ended by briefly previewing the idea of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Module theory/Modules over a PID/Jordan Canonical Form I - Definition\|Jordan canonical form]]. We'll cover that form in detail in the next class.

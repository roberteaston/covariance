This following is a very brief summary of what happened in class on 2024-11-08.

We recapped the constructions and key properties of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Tensor algebras\|tensor algebra]] and [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric algebras\|symmetric algebra]] constructions. We then finished the construction of the [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Exterior algebras\|exterior algebra]] and investigated some of its properties. We noted that in the exterior algebra $\bigwedge (M)$ we use the notation "wedge product" notation $z\wedge w$ for the product of two elements. The key feature of this new algebra is that $z\wedge z=0$ for every $z\in \bigwedge (M)$. We also saw that one consequence is that $m_1\wedge m_2 = -(m_2\wedge m_1)$ for $m_1, m_2\in M$. (We also warned that we do *not* always have $z\wedge w = -(w\wedge z)$ for general elements $z, w\in \bigwedge (M)$.)

We ended by noting that [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Algebra theory/Symmetric and alternating tensors#An action of the symmetric group on $ mathcal{T} k(M)$\|there is a left action of the symmetric group]] $S_k$ on the $k^{\text{th}}$-tensor power $\mathcal{T}^k(M)$. This allowed us to define the notions of **symmetric** and **alternating** tensors, and the collections of such tensors form submodules of $\mathcal{T}^k(M)$. There are also **symmetrization** and **skew-symmetrization** morphisms that, at least when $k!$ is a unit in $R$, provide isomorphisms of those submodules with $\mathcal{S}^k(M)$ and $\bigwedge^k (M)$, respectively.

Next week: modules over a PID!

## Project summary
---

One of the most important results in category theory is [[40-49 Knowledge/41 Mathematics/Category theory/Universal properties/Universal Properties III - Yoneda's Lemma\|Yoneda's Lemma]]. This lemma can take a bit to digest, but as a first approximation we can think of it as the foundation of the philosophy "It's all about the arrows." In short, Yoneda's Lemma tells us that an object in a category is completely characterized by the arrows to (or dually, from) that object.

We are going to take that philosophy to the extreme, by attempting to recharacterize "everything" in terms of arrows. While that sounds like a daunting task, we're going to approach it in a casual, relaxed way, working on concepts and ideas however we like. Some things, like encoding a "commutative diagram" in some category into a single arrow (in a different category) will be remarkably easy. Other things, like dealing with ideals of rings, will (likely) be much trickier. No worries! Our goal is simply to get this process started and see how far we can get this summer.

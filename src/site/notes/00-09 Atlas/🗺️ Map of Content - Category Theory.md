# Basic structures

>[!quote] Serge Lang
>In the forties and fifties (mostly in the works of Cartan, Eilenberg, MacLane, and Steenrod), it was realized that there was a systematic way of developing certain relations of linear algebra, depending only on fairly general constructions which were mostly arrow-theoretic, and were affectionately called abstract nonsense by Steenrod.

# Abelian categories

>[!quote] Mac Lane
>... the subject languished until ... the discovery by Grothendieck that categories of sheaves (of abelian groups) over a topological space were abelian categories but not categories of modules, and that homological algebra in these categories was needed for a complete treatment of sheaf cohomology. With this impetus, abelian categories joined the establishment.
